	abstract = {Connective tissue mechanical behavior is primarily determined by the composition and organization of collagen. In ligaments and tendons, type I collagen is the principal structural element of the extracellular matrix, which acts to transmit force between bones or bone and muscle, respectively. Therefore, characterization of collagen fibril morphology and organization in fetal and skeletally mature animals is essential to understanding how tissues develop and obtain their mechanical attributes. In this study, tendons and ligaments from fetal rat, bovine, and feline, and mature rat were examined with scanning electron microscopy. At early fetal developmental stages, collagen fibrils show fibril overlap and interweaving, apparent fibril ends, and numerous bifurcating/fusing fibrils. Late in fetal development, collagen fibril ends are still present and fibril bundles (fibers) are clearly visible. Examination of collagen fibrils from skeletally mature tissues, reveals highly organized regions but still include fibril interweaving, and regions that are more randomly organized. Fibril bifurcations/fusions are still present in mature tissues but are less numerous than in fetal tissue. To address the continuity of fibrils in mature tissues, fibrils were examined in individual micrographs and consecutive overlaid micrographs. Extensive microscopic analysis of mature tendons and ligaments detected no fibril ends. These data strongly suggest that fibrils in mature ligament and tendon are either continuous or functionally continuous. Based upon this information and published data, we conclude that force within these tissues is directly transferred through collagen fibrils and not through an interfibrillar coupling, such as a proteoglycan bridge.},

	abstract = {The receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (HER-2/neu) is overexpressed in up to 30\% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and an increased likelihood of metastasis especially in node-positive tumors. In this proteomic study, to identify the proteins that are associated with the aggressive phenotype of HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer, tumor cells from both HER-2/neu-positive and -negative tumors were procured by laser capture microdissection. Differentially expressed proteins in the two subsets of tumors were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. We found differential expression of several key cell cycle modulators, which were linked with increased proliferation of the HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. Nine proteins involved in glycolysis (triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and enolase 1 (ENO1)), lipid synthesis (fatty acid synthase (FASN)), stress-mediated chaperonage (heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27)), and antioxidant and detoxification pathways (haptoglobin, aldo-keto reductase (AKR), glyoxalase I (GLO), and prolyl-4-hydrolase β-isoform (P4HB)) were found to be up-regulated in HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors. HER-2/neu-dependent differential expression of PGK1, FASN, Hsp27, and GLO was further validated in four breast cancer cell lines and 12 breast tumors by immunoblotting and confirmed by partially switching off the HER-2/neu signaling in the high HER-2/neu-expressing SKBr3 cell line with Herceptin treatment. Statistical correlations of these protein expressions with HER-2/neu status were further verified by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray comprising 97 breast tumors. Our findings suggest that HER-2/neu signaling may result, directly or indirectly, in enhanced activation of various metabolic, stress-responsive, antioxidative, and detoxification processes within the breast tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that these identified changes in the cellular proteome are likely to drive cell proliferation and tissue invasion and that the key cell cycle modulators involved, when uncovered by future research, would serve as naturally useful targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to negate the metastatic potential of HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors.},

	abstract = {Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is a recommended treatment for breast cancer patients where the goal is to remove the tumor and a surrounding rim of normal tissue. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients return for additional surgeries to remove all of the cancer. Post-operative pathology is the gold standard for evaluating BCS margins but is limited due to the amount of tissue that can be sampled. Frozen section analysis and touch-preparation cytology have been proposed to address the surgical needs but also have sampling limitations. These issues represent an unmet clinical need for guidance in resecting malignant tissue intra-operatively and for pathological sampling. We have developed a quantitative spectral imaging device to examine margins intra-operatively. The context in which this technology is applied (intra-operative or post-operative setting) is influenced by time after excision and surgical factors including cautery and the presence of patent blue dye (specifically Lymphazurin™, used for sentinel lymph node mapping). Optical endpoints of hemoglobin ([THb]), fat ([β-carotene]), and fibroglandular content via light scattering ({\textless}µs’{\textgreater}) measurements were quantified from diffuse reflectance spectra of lumpectomy and mastectomy specimens using a Monte Carlo model. A linear longitudinal mixed-effects model was used to fit the optical endpoints for the cautery and kinetics studies. Monte Carlo simulations and tissue mimicking phantoms were used for the patent blue dye experiments. [THb], [β-carotene], and {\textless}µs’{\textgreater} were affected by {\textless}3.3\% error with {\textless}80 µM of patent blue dye. The percent change in [β-carotene], {\textless}µs’{\textgreater}, and [β-carotene]/{\textless}µs’{\textgreater} was {\textless}14\% in 30 minutes, while percent change in [THb] was {\textgreater}40\%. [β-carotene] and [β-carotene]/{\textless}µs’{\textgreater} were the only parameters not affected by cautery. This work demonstrates the importance of understanding the post-excision kinetics of ex-vivo tissue and the presence of cautery and patent blue dye for breast tumor margin assessment, to accurately interpret data and exploit underling sources of contrast.},

	abstract = {Background
We hypothesized that the method of breast cancer margin assessment may be associated with different rates of positive margins and residual carcinoma.
Methods
A total of 178 breast cancer specimens were divided into 2 groups (A and B) based on the margin assessment method used. Rates of positive margins, re-excision, and residual carcinoma at re-excision were compared and analyzed statistically.
Results
At least 1 margin was positive in 64.7\% in group A and in 65.2\% in group B. At directed re-excision 54\% in group A and 51\% in group B had residual carcinoma. The lateral margin was positive in 44\% in group A compared with 26\% in group B (P = .06). The posterior margin was positive in 19\% in group A and in 51\% in group B (P = .001).
Conclusions
Two different breast cancer specimen margin assessment methods had comparable rates of positive margins and residual carcinoma at re-excision. Different patterns of specific margin positivity suggest that the method of margin assessment may alter results.},

	abstract = {Abnormal cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, yet there is an absence of quantitative methods to dynamically image this powerful cellular function. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is a noninvasive, high-resolution, quantitative tool for monitoring cellular metabolism. OMI probes the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of the autofluorescent metabolic coenzymes reduced NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide. We confirm that OMI correlates with cellular glycolytic levels across a panel of human breast cell lines using standard assays of cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion (P {\textless} 0.05, r = 0.89). In addition, OMI resolves differences in the basal metabolic activity of untransformed from malignant breast cells (P {\textless} 0.05) and between breast cancer subtypes (P {\textless} 0.05), defined by estrogen receptor and/or HER2 expression or absence. In vivo OMI is sensitive to metabolic changes induced by inhibition of HER2 with the antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in mice. This response was confirmed with tumor growth curves and stains for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3. OMI resolved trastuzumab-induced changes in cellular metabolism in vivo as early as 48 hours posttreatment (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography did not resolve any changes with trastuzumab up to 12 days posttreatment (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, OMI resolved cellular subpopulations of differing response in vivo that are critical for investigating drug resistance mechanisms. Importantly, OMI endpoints remained unchanged with trastuzumab treatment in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts (P {\textgreater} 0.05). OMI has significant implications for rapid cellular-level assessment of metabolic response to molecular expression and drug action, which would greatly accelerate drug development studies.

Mitosis counts in histopathological slides play a crucial role for invasive breast cancer grading using the Nottingham grading system. Pathologists perform this grading by manual examinations of a few thousand images for each patient. Hence, finding the mitotic figures from these images is a tedious job and also prone to observer variability due to variations in the appearances of the mitotic cells. We propose a fast and accurate approach for automatic mitosis detection from histopathological images. We employ area morphological scale space for cell segmentation. The scale space is constructed in a novel manner by restricting the scales with the maximization of relative-entropy between the cells and the background. This results in precise cell segmentation. The segmented cells are classified in mitotic and non-mitotic category using the random forest classifier. Experiments show at least 12\% improvement in F1 score on more than 450 histopathological images at 40× magnification.},

Breast-conserving therapy, consisting of lumpectomy and radiation therapy, has become the standard local treatment for T1-T2 breast tumors. There is general agreement that successful breast conservation requires complete tumor excision with a "tumor-free" or "negative" margin of resection, but the definition of a negative margin is controversial. A commonly accepted definition of adequate margins requires a 2-mm distance between ink and tumor but opinions range from the original National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project definition of "no ink on tumor", to a recommended width of 10 mm or more. The ability to perform real-time molecular imaging analysis of margins during surgery would clearly be a significant advance; several groups have engaged in this effort, with encouraging reports of preliminary data. Further development of such techniques promises to lead to a point at which accurate intraoperative margin evaluation may be possible and may even be combined with therapeutic interventions, using techniques such as photodynamic therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
To clarify the pathology of the development of prostatic disorders such as inflammation, cancer, and hyperplasia, we compared histopathological findings of the prostate according to age group.
METHODS
Whole-mount sections of prostates were used to assess the relationship between age and prostate weight (n = 962), prostate histological composition in the transition zone (TZ) and in the peripheral zone (PZ) (n = 68), prostate histopathological findings by zone (n = 102), and comparison of latent tumor development by age group (n = 1,815).
RESULTS
A rapid increase in prostate weight from birth to the 20s was followed by a slow rise thereafter. Volume increases (P {\textless} 0.01) were observed in all components of glandular epithelium, glandular lumen, and stroma in the TZ from the 40s to 70s inclusive. In the PZ, the epithelial and stromal volumes tended to decrease in an age-dependent manner (P {\textless} 0.05). Calculi and lymphocyte infiltration were detected at a relatively early age, with a tendency towards an age-dependent increase. Glandular dilation and nodular hyperplasia were noted first in the 30s group, also with a tendency towards age-dependent increase. Latent tumors were first detected in the 30s group (5.6\%), and slowly increased thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS
There was an age-dependent trend towards prostate glandular dilation and prostate enlargement with inflammation. It was demonstrated that tumor and hyperplasia have a long natural history, usually starting in the fourth decade of life, accompanied by dynamic changes with age in glandular tissue composition as well as cell proliferation activity. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The immunosurveillance theory postulates that tumors evolve and progress in an uncontrolled fashion only when anticancer immune responses fail. Natural immunosurveillance clearly influences human breast cancer (BC) progression because the prognosis of BC patients is dictated by the density, composition and activity of the tumor immune infiltrate at diagnosis. Moreover, chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic regimens commonly employed for the treatment of BC affect the tumor immune infiltrate, and accumulating data suggest that the clinical efficacy of these treatments is largely determined by T cell–dependent tumor-specific immune responses. In addition, the mechanism of action of targeted anticancer therapeutics, such as the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2)-targeting agent trastuzumab, involves the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. In this Review, we discuss these findings as well as preliminary evidence indicating that immunotherapy constitutes a promising option for the treatment of BC. Moreover, we point out that the successful implementation of immunotherapy to BC management requires the optimization of current immunotherapeutic regimens and the identification of immunological biomarkers that enable improved risk stratification and the design of personalized, dynamic treatment plans.},

The lateral resolution of 90 nm and the optical sectioning depth of 120 μm were achieved. The maximum acquisition speed for 3D imaging in the optical sectioning mode was 1.6×107 pixels/second, which was mainly limited by the sensitivity and speed of the CCD camera. In contrast to other SIM techniques, the DMD-based LED-illumination SIM is cost-effective, ease of multi-wavelength switchable and speckle-noise-free. The 2D super-resolution and 3D optical sectioning modalities can be easily switched and applied to either fluorescent or non-fluorescent specimens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report on the potential DNA binding modes and spectral characteristics of the cell-permeant far red fluorescent DNA dye, DRAQ5, in solution and bound within intact cells. Our aim was to determine the constraints for its use in flow cytometry and bioimaging.
METHODS: Solution characteristics and quantum yields were determined by spectroscopy. DRAQ5 binding to nuclear DNA was analyzed using fluorescence quenching of Hoechst 33342 dye, emission profiling by flow cytometry, and spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy of the complex DRAQ5 emission spectrum. Cell cycle profiling utilized an EGFP-cyclin B1 reporter as an independent marker of cell age. Molecular modeling was used to explore the modes of DNA binding.
RESULTS: DRAQ5 showed a low quantum yield in solution and a spectral shift upon DNA binding, but no significant fluorescence enhancement. DRAQ5 caused a reduction in the fluorescence intensity of Hoechst 33342 in live cells prelabeled with the UV excitable dye, consistent with molecular modeling that suggests AT preference and an engagement of the minor groove. In vivo spectral analysis of DRAQ5 demonstrated shifts to longer wavelengths upon binding with DNA. Analysis of spectral windows of the dual emission peaks at 681 and 707 nm in cells showed that cell cycle compartment recognition was independent of the far red-near IR emission wavelengths monitored.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides new clues to modes of DNA binding of the modified anthraquinone molecule in vivo, and its AT base-pair selectivity. The combination of low quantum yield but high DNA affinity explains the favorable signal-to-noise profile of DRAQ5-nuclear fluorescence. The robust nature of cell cycle reporting using DRAQ5, even when restricted spectral windows are selected, facilitates the analysis of encroaching spectral emissions from other fluorescent reporters, including GFP-tagged proteins.},

	abstract = {Background
It is unclear whether the additional removal of breast tissue during breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for breast cancer beyond the standard lumpectomy reduces the incidence of inadequate microscopic margins found at pathological examination and subsequent reoperation. This study compares the reoperative rates after initial BCT in 3 groups of patients who underwent lumpectomy with complete resection of 4 to 6 additional margins, lumpectomy with selective resection of 1 to 3 additional margins, or standard lumpectomy.
Methods
Retrospective data were reviewed from 171 selected cases of BCT, from May 2000 to February 2006. Forty-five cases involved lumpectomy with complete resection of 4 to 6 additional margins; 77 involved lumpectomy with selective resection of 1 to 3 additional margins, whereas 49 involved standard lumpectomy. All samples underwent pathologic analysis of inked resection margins by permanent section. The 3 groups were compared for patient demographics, tumor size and histologic subtype, tumor stage, margin status, excised specimen volume, and eventual subsequent reoperation. Adequate surgical margin was defined as any negative margin greater than 2 mm.
Results
The group with complete resection of 4 to 6 additional margins had a subsequent reoperation rate of 17.7\%, whereas the group with selective resection of 1 to 3 additional margins and the standard lumpectomy group had a subsequent reoperation rate of 32.5\% and 38.7\%, respectively, because of inadequate margins. The mean total excised specimen volume in the 3 groups was 129.19, 46.04, and 37.44 cm3, respectively.
Conclusions
The complete resection of 4 to 6 additional margins during the initial BCT resulted in the lowest subsequent reoperation rate, and the largest total volume specimen excised among the 3 techniques studied.},

	abstract = {Cytokines have been shown to play an important role in tendon and ligament healing by regulating cellular differentiation and activity. The majority of studies that have investigated the role of cytokines in tendon and ligament healing have added them to injured tissue and assessed their effect. Because the efficacy of exogenously applying cytokines is dependent upon many factors such as the correct dosage, timing, and frequency, conflicting results are often reported. To avoid these factors, this study used transgenic mice with knockouts of interleukin-4 (IL4 −/−) and interleukin-6 (IL6 −/−) to investigate their role in tendon healing. Because of the reported roles of both of these cytokines in inflammation and fibroplasia, it was hypothesized that the order of organizational, geometric, and mechanical properties would be (greatest to least) injured IL6 −/−, injured control, and injured IL4 −/− mice. In addition, it was hypothesized that specific cytokines would be upregulated in each knockout group, but not compensate for the lack of IL-4 or IL-6. Mechanical and organizational properties of injured tendons from IL6 −/− mice were inferior to that of control and IL4 −/− mice despite the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Temporal levels of IL-10 and IL-13 in the IL4 −/− mice resulted in comparable and even superior properties when compared to CTL mice. This study shows that IL-6 could not be compensated for and plays an important role in tendon healing. This study also supports the use of this animal model to further investigate tendon healing.},

	abstract = {Background:
This study aimed to analyse the possibility of surgical rescue of intrabreast tumour recurrence (IBTR) following conservative operation for breast cancer, i.e. quadrantectomy, axillary dissection and radiotherapy.
Methods:
Of 2544 patients treated with this approach, 209 presented with an IBTR as the first and only sign of relapse. Some 197 patients were considered suitable for further surgery; 12 were inoperable. Six patients declined operation.
Results:
Reoperative surgery was total mastectomy in 134 patients (70 per cent) and further local resection in 57 (30 per cent). Median follow-up after second surgery was 73 (range 1–192) months. The overall survival probability at 60 months was 70 per cent after mastectomy and 85 per cent following further local excision. There was no difference in disease-free survival between the two operative groups. Second IBTR was more common at 5 years in the re-excision group (19 versus 4 per cent).
Conclusion:
Since the type of surgery did not seem to affect survival, breast conservation can be considered in selected patients with IBTR. © 1999 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd},

The supraspinatus tendons of rats were severed at the bony insertion and repaired surgically. The healing response was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-injury using histologic and in situ hybridization techniques. Expression patterns of collagens (I, II, III, IX, X, XII), proteoglycans (decorin, aggrecan, versican, biglycan, fibromodulin), and other extracellular matrix proteins (elastin, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase) were evaluated at the healing tendon to bone insertion site. Histologic results indicate a poor healing response to the injury, with only partial recreation of the insertion site by 8 weeks. In situ hybridization results indicate a specific pattern of genes expressed in each zone of the insertion site (i.e., tendon, fibrocartilage, mineralized cartilage, bone). Overall, expression of collagen types I and XII, aggrecan, and biglycan was increased, while expression of collagen type X and decorin was decreased. Expression of collagen type I, collagen type XII, and biglycan decreased over time, but remained above normal at 8 weeks. Results indicate that the rat supraspinatus tendon is ineffective in recreating the original insertion site, even at 8 weeks post-injury, in the absence of biological or biomechanical enhancements. © 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Advances in screening have not had an impact on mortality in women who are too young to be candidates for screening. Risk factors for early breast cancer include a lean body habitus and recent use of an oral contraceptive. Breast cancers in very young women are typically aggressive, in part owing to the over-representation of high-grade, triple-negative tumours, but young age is an independent negative predictor of cancer-specific survival. Very early age-of-onset also correlates strongly with the risk of local recurrence and with the odds of contralateral breast cancer. Given the high risks of local and distant recurrence in young women with invasive breast cancer, most (if not all) young patients are candidates for chemotherapy. It is hoped that by increasing breast cancer awareness, the proportion of invasive breast cancers that are diagnosed at 2.0 cm or smaller will increase and that this will lead to a reduction in mortality.},

	abstract = {A critical barrier for the successful prevention and treatment of recurrent prostate cancer is detection and eradication of metastatic and therapy-resistant disease. Despite the fall in diagnoses and mortality, the reported incidence of metastatic disease has increased 72\% since 2004. Prostate cancer arises in cohesive groups as intraepithelial neoplasia, migrates through muscle and leaves the gland via perineural invasion for hematogenous dissemination. Current technological advances have shown cohesive-clusters of tumor (also known as microemboli) within the circulation. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) profiles are indicative of disseminated prostate cancer, and disseminated tumor cells (DTC) are found in cohesive-clusters, a phenotypic characteristic of both radiation- and drug-resistant tumors. Recent reports in cell biology and informatics, coupled with mass spectrometry, indicate that the integrin adhesome network provides an explanation for the biophysical ability of cohesive-clusters of tumor cells to invade thorough muscle and nerve microenvironments while maintaining adhesion-dependent therapeutic resistance. Targeting cohesive-clusters takes advantage of the known ability of extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion to promote tumor cell survival and represents an approach that has the potential to avoid the progression to drug- and radiotherapy-resistance. In the following review we will examine the evidence for development and dissemination of cohesive-clusters in metastatic prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Previous implementations of structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) were slow or designed for one-color excitation, sacrificing two unique and extremely beneficial aspects of light microscopy: live-cell imaging in multiple colors. This is especially unfortunate because, among the resolution-extending techniques, SIM is an attractive choice for live-cell imaging; it requires no special fluorophores or high light intensities to achieve twice diffraction-limited resolution in three dimensions. Furthermore, its wide-field nature makes it light-efficient and decouples the acquisition speed from the size of the lateral field of view, meaning that high frame rates over large volumes are possible. Here, we report a previously undescribed SIM setup that is fast enough to record 3D two-color datasets of living whole cells. Using rapidly programmable liquid crystal devices and a flexible 2D grid pattern algorithm to switch between excitation wavelengths quickly, we show volume rates as high as 4 s in one color and 8.5 s in two colors over tens of time points. To demonstrate the capabilities of our microscope, we image a variety of biological structures, including mitochondria, clathrin-coated vesicles, and the actin cytoskeleton, in either HeLa cells or cultured neurons.},

Ten established human cancer cell lines from colon carcinomas and neuroblastomas were inoculated subcutaneously in athymic mice and the doubling time (DT) of the xenograft tumour mass was calculated. The tumour DTs ranged from 3.2 to 15.7 days. Nucleolar size was evaluated in sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumour samples after silver staining for AgNOR proteins, using a specific image analysis system. The nucleolar area values were inversely related to the xenograft tumour mass DTs (r=−0.90; p{\textless}0.001). Nucleolar functional activity was also evaluated using rapid, intermediate, and slow growing tumours (one each). The values of RNA polymerase I activity measured in vitro were strongly related to the corresponding tumour DTs (r=−0.99; p=0.03). The labelling indices (LIs) of three proliferation markers, MIB1, PCNA, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), were also evaluated. As revealed by the MIB1 and PCNA LIs, almost all the cells of the xenograft tumours were cycling (86.6±5.6 SD and 95.5±2.0 SD, respectively). Neither the MIB1, PCNA or BrdU LIs were related to the xenograft tumour mass DT, showing that the different growth rates of tumour xenografts were not due to different growth fractions, but were mainly related to different cell proliferation rates. The present data demonstrate that the size and function of the nucleolus are related to the cell proliferation rate of cancer tissue. Evaluation of nucleolar size after silver staining of AgNOR proteins represents a unique parameter for the histological assessment of rapidity of cell proliferation in tumour lesions.

Here we describe how this method can be applied in three dimensions to double the axial as well as the lateral resolution, with true optical sectioning. A grating is used to generate three mutually coherent light beams, which interfere in the specimen to form an illumination pattern that varies both laterally and axially. The spatially structured excitation intensity causes normally unreachable high-resolution information to become encoded into the observed images through spatial frequency mixing. This new information is computationally extracted and used to generate a three-dimensional reconstruction with twice as high resolution, in all three dimensions, as is possible in a conventional wide-field microscope. The method has been demonstrated on both test objects and biological specimens, and has produced the first light microscopy images of the synaptonemal complex in which the lateral elements are clearly resolved.},

In this paper, the results from the Assessment of Mitosis Detection Algorithms 2013 (AMIDA13) challenge are described. The challenge was based on a data set consisting of 12 training and 11 testing subjects, with more than one thousand annotated mitotic figures by multiple observers. Short descriptions and results from the evaluation of eleven methods are presented.

	abstract = {A challenge in biological imaging is to capture high-resolution images at fast frame rates in live cells. The “instant structured illumination microscope” (iSIM) is a system designed for this purpose. Similarly to standard structured illumination microscopy (SIM), an iSIM provides a twofold improvement over widefield microscopy, in x, y and z, but also allows much faster image acquisition, with real-time display of super-resolution images.

The assembly of an iSIM is reasonably complex, involving the combination and alignment of many optical components, including three micro-optics arrays (two lenslet arrays and an array of pinholes, all with a pitch of 222 μm) and a double-sided scanning mirror. In addition, a number of electronic components must be correctly controlled. Construction of the system is therefore not trivial, but is highly desirable, particularly for live-cell imaging.

We report, and provide instructions for, the construction of an iSIM, including minor modifications to a previous design in both hardware and software. The final instrument allows us to rapidly acquire fluorescence images at rates faster than 100 fps, with approximately twofold improvement in resolution in both x–y and z; sub-diffractive biological features have an apparent size (full width at half maximum) of 145 nm (lateral) and 320 nm (axial), using a 1.49 NA objective and 488 nm excitation.},

Luminal breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease comprising different histologies, gene-expression profiles and mutational patterns, with very varied clinical courses and responses to systemic treatment. Despite adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy treatment for patients at high risk of relapse, both early and late relapses still occur, a fact that highlights the unmet medical needs of these patients. Ongoing research aims to identify those patients who can be spared adjuvant chemotherapy and who will benefit from extended adjuvant hormone therapy. This research also aims to explore the role of adjuvant bisphosphonates, to interrogate new agents for targeting minimal residual disease, and to address endocrine resistance. Data from next-generation sequencing studies have given us new insight into the biology of luminal breast cancer and, together with advances in preclinical models and the availability of newer targeted agents, have led to the testing of rationally chosen combination treatments in clinical trials. However, a major challenge will be to make sense of the large amount of patient genomic data that is becoming increasingly available. This analysis will be critical to our understanding how intertumour and intratumour heterogeneity can influence treatment response and resistance.},

	abstract = {Tendons are composed of fibroblasts and collagen fibrils. The fibrils are organized uniaxially and grouped together into fibers. Collagen VI is a non-fibrillar collagen expressed in developing and adult tendons. Human collagen VI mutations result in muscular dystrophy, joint hyperlaxity and contractures. The purpose of this study is to determine the functional roles of collagen VI in tendon matrix assembly. During tendon development, collagen VI was expressed throughout the extracellular matrix, but enriched around fibroblasts and their processes. To analyze the functional roles of collagen VI a mouse model with a targeted inactivation of Col6a1 gene was utilized. Ultrastructural analysis of Col6a1−/− versus wild type tendons demonstrated disorganized extracellular micro-domains and associated collagen fibers in the Col6a1−/− tendon. In Col6a1−/− tendons, fibril structure and diameter distribution were abnormal compared to wild type controls. The diameter distributions were shifted significantly toward the smaller diameters in Col6a1−/− tendons compared to controls. An analysis of fibril density (number/μm2) demonstrated a {\textasciitilde} 2.5 fold increase in the Col6a1−/− versus wild type tendons. In addition, the fibril arrangement and structure were aberrant in the peri-cellular regions of Col6a1−/− tendons with frequent very large fibrils and twisted fibrils observed restricted to this region. The biomechanical properties were analyzed in mature tendons. A significant decrease in cross-sectional area was observed. The percent relaxation, maximum load, maximum stress, stiffness and modulus were analyzed and Col6a1−/− tendons demonstrated a significant reduction in maximum load and stiffness compared to wild type tendons. An increase in matrix metalloproteinase activity was suggested in the absence of collagen VI. This suggests alterations in tenocyte expression due to disruption of cell–matrix interactions. The changes in expression may result in alterations in the peri-cellular environment. In addition, the absence of collagen VI may alter the sequestering of regulatory molecules such as leucine rich proteoglycans. These changes would result in dysfunctional regulation of tendon fibrillogenesis indirectly mediated by collagen VI.},

	abstract = {How precisely does the brain predict the sensory consequences of our actions? Efference copy is thought to reflect the predicted sensation of self-produced motor acts, such as the auditory feedback heard while speaking. Here, we use magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEG-I) in human speakers to demonstrate that efference copy prediction does not track movement variability across repetitions of the same motor task. Specifically, spoken vowels were less accurately predicted when they were less similar to a speaker's median production, even though the prediction is thought to be based on the very motor commands that generate each vowel. Auditory cortical responses to less prototypical speech productions were less suppressed, resembling responses to speech errors, and were correlated with later corrective movement, suggesting that the suppression may be functionally significant for error correction. The failure of the motor system to accurately predict less prototypical speech productions suggests that the efferent-driven suppression does not reflect a sensory prediction, but a sensory goal.},

	abstract = {Objectives. The nucleus controls cell function and behavior. The nuclear matrix determines internal nuclear changes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is the reference standard for the analysis of nuclear matrix protein (NMP) composition. Differences in NMP composition should therefore be reflected by changes in nuclear shape. We investigated the differences in NMP composition and nuclear morphometry of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Both tissues are androgen-dependent sex accessory organs with completely different biologic behavior.

Methods. High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and silver staining were used to evaluate NMP composition from histologically normal prostate and seminal vesicle epithelial cells. Nuclear morphometry, performed using a computer-assisted image analysis system, described the distribution, variability, and extremes of nuclear shape.

Results. NMP composition analysis demonstrated that both tissues have a similar NMP composition, and tissue-specific NMPs that were consistently present in all specimens of each tissue could not be demonstrated. Nuclear morphometry showed a significantly greater heterogeneity in nuclear shape in the seminal vesicles than in the prostate.

Conclusions. The striking similarity of the NMP composition demonstrates the close biologic relationship between prostate and seminal vesicle tissue. The similar NMP composition does not correlate with the marked alterations in nuclear shape and structure between these tissues. Therefore, nuclear morphometry may depict differences in the functional state of a similar set of NMPs, shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which may be responsible for the different biologic behavior of these tissues.},

In particular, using ideas from algebraic topology we construct topological descriptors based on cell nucleus segmentations such as persistency charts and Betti sequences. We assess their performance on the task of discriminating the breast cancer subtypes Basal, Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2. We demonstrate that the topological features contain useful complementary information to image-appearance based features that can improve discriminatory performance of classifiers.},

Special emphasis is placed on the modelling of soft biological tissues at finite strains. For this, we adopt the nowadays well-known kinematic assumption of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic part and a growth part. It is shown how continuum thermodynamics is crucial in setting convenient forms for the coupling between stress and growth in general. The particularization to isotropy simplifies considerably the growth modelling from both the theoretical and the numerical points of view. Simple growth constitutive equations are proposed and embedded into a finite element context. Finally, representative numerical examples examining stress-dependent growth and residual stress arising from growth and resorption close this study. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background Successful breast-conserving therapy in DCIS is restricted by high rates of residual disease resulting in the need for radiotherapy and/or re-excision. This study identifies patients with DCIS who are most at risk of compromised margins and of residual disease. Methods All patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery for DCIS over a 6-year period were included. Method of diagnosis, mammographic size, pathological size, DCIS-margin distance and residual disease on re-excision were analysed. Results One hundred and thirty-five patients underwent initial breast-conserving surgery for DCIS. The compromised margin rate was 72\%, and the rate of residual disease on re-operation was 54\%. On univariate analysis, underestimation of pathological size by mammography by {\textgreater}1 cm occurred in 40\% of those with compromised margins undergoing a therapeutic operation compared to only 14\% of those with clear margins (P = 0.02). However, on multivariate analysis only pathological size (P {\textless} 0.0001, OR = 1.0,95\% CI 1.037–1.128) and lack of a preoperative diagnosis by core biopsy (P {\textless} 0.0001, OR = 5.3,95\% CI 1.859–15.08) were predictive of compromised margins. The presence of residual disease on re-excision was associated with increasing pathological size (P {\textless} 0.0001, OR = 1.085,95\% CI 1.038–1.134) and decreasing DCIS-margin distance (P = 0.03, OR = 6.694,95\% CI 1.84–37.855). Twenty-nine percent (n = 13/45) of lesions ≤3 cm compared to 84\% (n = 27/32) of lesions {\textgreater}3 cm had residual disease on re-operation (P {\textless} 0.0001). Residual disease was present in 62\% (n = 34/55), 64\% (n = 7/11) and 17\% (n = 2/12) of patients with DCIS-margin distances ≤1, 1–2 and 2–5 mm, respectively. Conclusion Considerable underestimation of DCIS extent by mammography occurs in a high proportion of patients with compromised margins in breast conservation. Patients at particularly high risk of residual disease on re-excision are those with lesions {\textgreater}3 cm and those with DCIS-margin distances of ≤ 2mm.},

	abstract = {Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), a severe fungal disease causing yield losses worldwide, is most effectively controlled by resistant varieties. Genomic prediction could greatly aid resistance breeding efforts. However, the development of accurate prediction models requires large training sets of genotyped and phenotyped individuals. Maize hybrid breeding is based on distinct heterotic groups that maximize heterosis (the dent and flint groups in Central Europe). The resulting allocation of resources to parallel breeding programs challenges the establishment of sufficiently sized training sets within groups. Therefore, using training sets combining both heterotic groups might be a possibility of increasing training set sizes and thereby prediction accuracies. The objectives of our study were to assess the prospect of genomic prediction of NCLB resistance in maize and the benefit of a training set that combines two heterotic groups. Our data comprised 100 dent and 97 flint lines, phenotyped for NCLB resistance per se and genotyped with high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism marker data. A genomic BLUP model was used to predict genotypic values. Prediction accuracies reached a maximum of 0.706 (dent) and 0.690 (flint), and there was a strong positive response to increases in training set size. The use of combined training sets led to significantly greater prediction accuracies for both heterotic groups. Our results encourage the application of genomic prediction in NCLB-resistance breeding programs and the use of combined training sets.},

Live cell fluorescence microscopy experiments often require visualization of the nucleus and the chromatin to determine the nuclear morphology or the localization of nuclear compartments.
Methods
We compared five different DNA dyes, TOPRO-3, TOTO-3, propidium iodide, Hoechst 33258, and DRAQ5, to test their usefulness in live cell experiments with continuous imaging and photobleaching in widefield epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, we compared the DNA stainings with fluorescent histones as an independent fluorescent label to mark chromatin.
Results
From the dyes tested, only Hoechst and DRAQ5 could be used to stain DNA in living cells. However, DRAQ5 had several advantages, namely low photobleaching, labeling of the chromatin compartments comparable to that of H2B-GFP fusion proteins, and deep red excitation/emission compatible with available genetically encoded fluorescent proteins such as C/G/YFP or mRFP.
Conclusions
The DNA dye DRAQ5 is well suited for chromatin visualization in living cells and can easily be combined with other fluorophores with blue to orange emission. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background
The presence of tumor cells at the margins of breast lumpectomy specimens is associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral tumor recurrence. Twenty to 30 \% of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery require second procedures to achieve negative margins. This study evaluated the adjunctive use of the MarginProbe device (Dune Medical Devices Ltd, Caesarea, Israel) in providing real-time intraoperative assessment of lumpectomy margins.

Methods
This multicenter randomized trial enrolled patients with nonpalpable breast malignancies. The study evaluated MarginProbe use in addition to standard intraoperative methods for margin assessment. After specimen removal and inspection, patients were randomized to device or control arms. In the device arm, MarginProbe was used to examine the main lumpectomy specimens and direct additional excision of positive margins. Intraoperative imaging was used in both arms; no intraoperative pathology assessment was permitted.

Results

In total, 596 patients were enrolled. False-negative rates were 24.8 and 66.1 \% and false-positive rates were 53.6 and 16.6 \% in the device and control arms, respectively. All positive margins on positive main specimens were resected in 62 \% (101 of 163) of cases in the device arm, versus 22 \% (33 of 147) in the control arm (p {\textless} 0.001). A total of 19.8 \% (59 of 298) of patients in the device arm underwent a reexcision procedure compared with 25.8 \% (77 of 298) in the control arm (6 \% absolute, 23 \% relative reduction). The difference in tissue volume removed was not significant.

Conclusions
Adjunctive use of the MarginProbe device during breast-conserving surgery improved surgeons’ ability to identify and resect positive lumpectomy margins in the absence of intraoperative pathology assessment, reducing the number of patients requiring reexcision. MarginProbe may aid performance of breast-conserving surgery by reducing the burden of reexcision procedures for patients and the health care system.},

Previously, we developed a fluorescence structured illumination microscope (SIM) system with a single-shot field of view (FOV) of 2.1×1.6 mm (3.4 mm2) and sub-cellular resolution (4.4 μm). The goal of this study was to test the utility of this technology for the detection of residual disease in a genetically engineered mouse model of sarcoma. Primary soft tissue sarcomas were generated in the hindlimb and after the tumor was surgically removed, the relevant margin was stained with acridine orange (AO), a vital stain that brightly stains cell nuclei and fibrous tissues. The tissues were imaged with the SIM system with the primary goal of visualizing fluorescent features from tumor nuclei. Given the heterogeneity of the background tissue (presence of adipose tissue and muscle), an algorithm known as maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) was optimized and applied to the images to specifically segment nuclear features. A logistic regression model was used to classify a tissue site as positive or negative by calculating area fraction and shape of the segmented features that were present and the resulting receiver operator curve (ROC) was generated by varying the probability threshold. Based on the ROC curves, the model was able to classify tumor and normal tissue with 77\% sensitivity and 81\% specificity (Youden’s index). For an unbiased measure of the model performance, it was applied to a separate validation dataset that resulted in 73\% sensitivity and 80\% specificity. When this approach was applied to representative whole margins, for a tumor probability threshold of 50\%, only 1.2\% of all regions from the negative margin exceeded this threshold, while over 14.8\% of all regions from the positive margin exceeded this threshold.},

	abstract = {Introduction
In this study, we compare the indications for re-excision, the findings of additional tumor in the re-excision specimen as they relate to margin status, and costs associated with re-excision based on recent new consensus statements.
Materials and methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on 462 patients with invasive breast carcinoma who underwent at least one lumpectomy between January 2011 and December 2013. Postoperative data was analyzed based on where additional disease was found, as it relates to the margin status of the initial lumpectomy and the additional direct costs associated with additional procedures.
Results
Of the 462 patients sampled, 149 underwent a re-excision surgery (32.2\%). Four patients underwent mastectomy as their second operation. In the 40 patients with additional disease found on re-excision, 36 (90.0\%) of them had a positive margin on their initial lumpectomy. None of the four mastectomy patients had residual disease. The mean cost of the initial lumpectomy for all 462 patients was \$2118.01 plus an additional \$1801.92 for those who underwent re-excision.
Discussion
A positive margin was most predictive of finding residual tumor on re-excision as would be expected. Using old criteria only 0.07\% (4/61) of patients who had undergone re-excision with a ‘clear’ margin, had additional tumor found, at a total cost of \$106,354.11. Thus, the new consensus guidelines will lead to less overall cost, at no clinical risk to patients while reducing a patient's surgical risk and essentially eliminating delays in adjuvant care.},

"Neurally impaired" versions of the neurocomputational speech production model GODIVA were utilized to test two hypotheses: (1) that white-matter abnormalities disturb the circuit via corticostriatal projections carrying copies of executed motor commands and (2) that dopaminergic abnormalities disturb the circuit via the striatum. Simulation results support both hypotheses: in both scenarios, the neural abnormalities delay readout of the next syllable's motor program, leading to dysfluency. The results also account for brain imaging findings during dysfluent speech. It is concluded that each of the two abnormality types can cause stuttering moments, probably by affecting the same BG-thalamus-vPMC circuit.},

In this study, we have quantified the racemization of aspartic acid to calculate the age of the collagenous and non-collagenous components of the high strain injury-prone superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and low strain rarely injured common digital extensor tendon (CDET) in a group of horses with a wide age range. In addition, the turnover of collagen was assessed indirectly by measuring the levels of collagen degradation markers (collagenase-generated neoepitope and cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen). The fractional increase in d-Asp was similar (p = 0.7) in the SDFT (5.87 × 10−4/year) and CDET (5.82 × 10−4/year) tissue, and d/l-Asp ratios showed a good correlation with pentosidine levels. We calculated a mean (±S.E.) collagen half-life of 197.53 (±18.23) years for the SDFT, which increased significantly with horse age (p = 0.03) and was significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher than that for the CDET (34.03 (±3.39) years). Using similar calculations, the half-life of non-collagenous protein was 2.18 (±0.41) years in the SDFT and was significantly (p = 0.04) lower than the value of 3.51 (±0.51) years for the CDET. Collagen degradation markers were higher in the CDET and suggested an accumulation of partially degraded collagen within the matrix with aging in the SDFT. We propose that increased susceptibility to injury in older individuals results from an inability to remove partially degraded collagen from the matrix leading to reduced mechanical competence.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is primarily based on morphological analysis. Nucleomegaly, prominent nucleoli, and hyperchromasia constitute current nuclear diagnostic parameters but are seen in benign conditions, vary with Gleason grade, and pose diagnostic challenge in well-differentiated tumors with accompanying inflammation or equivocal architectural features. In such cases, other pleomorphic nuclear features such as variation in size and shape, irregular contours, nuclear membrane infoldings, and nonuniform chromatin, which are not incorporated in formal evaluation, may prove helpful. Our aim was to study different nuclear morphological features of prostate adenocarcinoma (including currently practiced ones) and highlight their variation with Gleason grades. We examined 84 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma using oil immersion microscopy where necessary. Commonest Gleason pattern observed was grade 4a accounting for 42.8\% of cases. Nuclear enlargement (moderate to marked in 93.8\%), nucleolar enlargement (62.1\%), and nonuniform chromatin distribution (100\%) could serve as useful diagnostic features but did not vary with tumor differentiation. Pleomorphism (moderate in 58.6\%), nuclear overlapping (62.8\%), nuclear membrane infoldings (66.2\%), and irregular contours (frequent in 94.5\%) were significant diagnostic features that increased in frequency and extent with increasing grade and could be used to differentiate low-grade from high-grade tumors. Worsening of nuclear morphology with advancing tumor grades indicated that nuclear anaplasia accompanies poor architectural differentiation. Coexistence of pale and dark nuclei signified variable chromatin density of no diagnostic significance.},

	abstract = {Background: The majority of women with invasive breast cancer are treated surgically by breast conserving surgery (BCS). A significant proportion subsequently undergo re-excision to obtain clear margins. However what constitutes a sufficient negative margin continues to be subject of controversy. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between margin width and ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) as well as identifying factors associated with residual disease after repeat surgery, and to determine the effect of re-excision on IBTR in a population-based nationwide cohort.
Method: 11,900 patients treated with breast conserving therapy for unilateral invasive cancer in Denmark between 2000 and 2009 were included. All patients received whole breast irradiation and were offered systemic adjuvant treatment according to the guidelines of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.
Results: The median follow-up was 4.9 years. The cumulative incidence of IBTR at 5 and 9 year was 2.4\% and 5.9\%, respectively. No decrease in IBTR with a wider negative margin compared to a narrow but negative margin was seen in adjusted analysis ({\textgreater}0-1 mm vs. 2-4 mm vs. ≥5 mm (reference): HR 1.54 (CI 95\% 0.81-2.93) vs 0.95 (CI 95\% 0.56-1.62) vs. 1). A final positive margin did however increase the risk of IBTR (HR 2.51; 95\% CI 1.02-6.23). Other factors associated with increased IBTR were young age (HR 3.10; 95\% CI 1.89-5.10), more than 4 positive lymph nodes (HR 1.80; 95\% CI 1.24-2.62), and re-excision (HR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.16-2.02). Receiving chemotherapy (HR 0.45; 95\% CI 0.33-0.61) or boost (HR 0.43; 95\% CI 0.31-0.60) reduced risk of IBTR as did being oestrogen receptor positive treated with (HR 0.35; 95\% CI 0.25-0.49) or without (HR 0.43; 95\% CI 0.31-0.60) adjuvant endocrine therapy.
Within two months of initial BCS 1342 women (11\%) had a re-excision. Residual disease was found in 20\% of re-excisions. In adjusted analysis DCIS outside the invasive tumour (OR 2.69; 95\% CI 1.99-3.63), positive initial margin (OR 2.26, 95\% CI 1.70-2.99, p{\textless}0.001), and age {\textless}50 years (OR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.00-2.31) was associated with increased risk of residual disease. Patients with residual disease after re-excision had in the adjusted analysis an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR), regardless of whether residual findings were invasive carcinoma (HR 2.97, CI 95\% 1.57-5.62) or DCIS (HR 2.58, CI 95\% 1.50-4.45). However no difference was seen for overall survival comparing one procedure with repeat surgery with or without residual disease (p=0.96).
Conclusion: An overall low rate of IBTR was seen. While a final positive margin was associated with a more than two-fold risk of IBTR, no evidence of improved local control was found with wider negative margins compared to narrow. However the finding of residual disease at re-excision was associated with an increased risk of IBTR.

	abstract = {Background
For the analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics, various automated processing methods have been developed for nuclei segmentation. These methods tend to be complex for segmentation of images with crowded nuclei, preventing the simple reapplication of the methods to other problems. Thus, it is useful to evaluate the ability of simple methods to segment images with various degrees of crowded nuclei.

Results
Here, we selected six simple methods from various watershed based and local maxima detection based methods that are frequently used for nuclei segmentation, and evaluated their segmentation accuracy for each developmental stage of the Caenorhabditis elegans. We included a 4D noise filter, in addition to 2D and 3D noise filters, as a pre-processing step to evaluate the potential of simple methods as widely as possible. By applying the methods to image data between the 50- to 500-cell developmental stages at 50-cell intervals, the error rate for nuclei detection could be reduced to ≤ 2.1\% at every stage until the 350-cell stage. The fractions of total errors throughout the stages could be reduced to ≤ 2.4\%. The error rates improved at most of the stages and the total errors improved when a 4D noise filter was used. The methods with the least errors were two watershed-based methods with 4D noise filters. For all the other methods, the error rate and the fraction of errors could be reduced to ≤ 4.2\% and ≤ 4.1\%, respectively. The minimum error rate for each stage between the 400- to 500-cell stages ranged from 6.0\% to 8.4\%. However, similarities between the computational and manual segmentations measured by volume overlap and Hausdorff distance were not good. The methods were also applied to Drosophila and zebrafish embryos and found to be effective.

Conclusions
The simple segmentation methods were found to be useful for detecting nuclei until the 350-cell stage, but not very useful after the 400-cell stage. The incorporation of a 4D noise filter to the simple methods could improve their performances. Error types and the temporal biases of errors were dependent on the methods used. Combining multiple simple methods could also give good segmentations.},

	abstract = {We introduce a noncontact imaging method utilizing multifrequency structured illumination for improving lateral and axial resolution and contrast of fluorescent molecular probes in thick, multiple-scattering tissue phantoms. The method can be implemented rapidly using a spatial light modulator and a simple image demodulation scheme similar to structured light microscopy in the diffraction regime. However, imaging is performed in the multiple-scattering regime utilizing spatially modulated scalar photon density waves. We demonstrate that by increasing the structured light spatial frequency, fluorescence from deeper structures is suppressed and signals from more superficial objects enhanced. By measuring the spatial frequency dependence of fluorescence, background can be reduced by localizing the signal to a buried fluorescent object. Overall, signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and resolution improvements are dependent on spatial frequency and object depth∕dimension with as much as sevenfold improvement in SBR and 33\% improvement in resolution for ∼1-mm objects buried 3 mm below the surface in tissue-like media with fluorescent background.},

They were killed at 7 and 14 days after the injury. A dose-dependent increase in the number of proliferating cells and the level of expression of type III collagen was demonstrated at only 7 days post-injury. On the other hand, we found no effects of bFGF on ultimate stress and the pyridinoline content of healing tendons. Only time significantly affected both strength-associated parameters. We showed that in vivo supplementation with bFGF affected the initial events of healing such as cell proliferation and type III collagen expression.},

	abstract = {Background Achieving negative surgical margins is critical to minimizing the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery (BCS) for a breast malignancy. Our objective was to perform a systematic review comparing reexcision rates, sensitivity and specificity of the intraoperative use of the margin assessment techniques of imprint cytology (IC) and frozen section analysis (FSA), against permanent histopathologic section (PS). Methods The databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library and CINAHL Plus were searched for literature published from 1997 to 2011. Original investigations of patients who underwent BCS for breast cancer that evaluated margin assessment with PS and/or IC or FSA were included. Of 182 titles identified, 41 patient cohorts from 37 articles met inclusion criteria: PS (n = 19), IC (n = 7) and FSA (n = 15). Studies were summarized qualitatively using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist for cohort studies and the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) numerical scale for diagnostic studies. Results The final reexcision rates after primary BCS were 35 \% for PS, 11 \% for IC (p = 0.001 vs. PS) and 10 \% for FSA (p {\textless} 0.0001 vs. PS). For IC, reexcision rates decreased from 26 to 4 \% (p = 0.18) and for FSA, reexcision rates decreased from 27 to 6 \% (p {\textless} 0.0001). The pooled sensitivity of IC and FSA were 72 and 83 \%. The pooled specificity of IC and FSA were 97 and 95 \%. The average length of each technique was 13 min for IC and 27 min for FSA. Conclusions Patients who underwent BCS with intraoperative IC or FSA to assess negative surgical margins had significantly fewer secondary surgical procedures for excision of their breast malignancies.},

	abstract = {For many years, patient age, axillary lymph node status, tumor size, histological features (especially histological grade and lymphovascular invasion), hormone receptor status, and HER2 status have been the major factors used to categorize patients with breast cancer in order to assess prognosis and determine the appropriate therapy. These factors are most often viewed in combination to group patients into various risk categories. Although these risk categories are useful for assessing prognosis and risk in groups of patients with breast cancer, their role in determining prognosis and evaluating risk in an individual patient is more limited. Therefore, better methods are required to help assess prognosis and determine the most appropriate treatment for patients on an individual basis. Recently, various molecular techniques, particular gene expression profiling, have been increasingly used to help refine breast cancer classification and to assess prognosis and response to therapy. Although the precise role of these newer techniques in the daily management of patients with breast cancer continues to evolve, it is clear that they have the potential to provide value above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical and pathological prognostic and predictive factors.},

	abstract = {Estrogen has many positive effects on neural tissue in experimental model systems, including stimulation of neurite growth and neurotransmitter synthesis and protection against diverse types of neural injury. In humans, estrogen treatment is reputed to protect against Alzheimer's disease. To investigate potential mediators of estrogen's action and determine whether selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen have estrogen-like effects in the primate brain, we evaluated the expression of glucose transporters and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor in the frontal cortex of ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. We treated one group for 3 days with vehicle, another with 17 beta estradiol (E2), and a third with tamoxifen. The expression of facilitative glucose transporters (Gluts) 1, 3, and 4 was investigated using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblot analysis. Gluts 3 and 4 were concentrated in cortical neurons and Glut1 in capillaries and glial cells. E2 treatment induced two- to fourfold increases in Glut3 and Glut4 mRNA levels and lesser but significant increases in Glut3 and 4 protein levels. E2 treatment induced an approximately 70\% increase in parenchymal Glut1 mRNA levels, but did not appreciably affect vascular Glut1 gene expression. IGF1 and IGF1 receptor mRNAs were concentrated in cortical neurons in a distribution similar to Gluts 3 and 4. IGF1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in E2-treated animals but IGF1 receptor mRNA levels were not altered by hormone treatment. Tamoxifen increased cerebral cortical Glut3 and 4 mRNA levels, but did not affect Glut1, IGF1, or IGF1 receptor expression. This study provides novel data showing that Gluts 3 and 4 and IGF1 are coexpressed by primate cerebral cortical neurons, where their expression is enhanced by estrogen. These findings suggest that up-regulation of glucose transporter and IGF1 expression may contribute to estrogen's salutary effects on neural tissue. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen at the breast, is shown to have estrogen-like effects on higher brain centers in the monkey, suggesting that some SERMs may share estrogen's neuroprotective potential for menopausal women.},

The aim of this study was to assess intraoperative entire-circumferential frozen section analysis (IEFSA) of the lumpectomy margins during BCS. Methods A total of 1029 patients who underwent BCS with IEFSA between June 2007 and July 2013 were available for assessment. The inner surfaces of the shaved lumpectomy margins were examined as frozen sections during BCS. The margins were defined as positive when the cancer cells were present within 5 mm from the edge of the outermost margins of the specimens. Results Out of 1029 patients, 312 patients (30.3 \%) had positive margins after the initial lumpectomy and underwent additional resections during BCS. Fourteen patients (1.4 \%) underwent mastectomy following the results of additional resections during the first surgery. Of 1015 patients who completed BCS, 60 patients (5.9 \%) were found to have positive margins in the final pathology. One patient (0.1 \%) underwent re-operation after BCS while the residual diseases of the other 59 patients were judged to be minimal. Of the 312 patients who were judged to have positive margins after the initial lumpectomy with IEFSA, 53 patients (16.9 \%) were found to have negative margins in the final pathology. At a median follow-up time of 54.1 months, one patient (0.1 \%) had a recurrence of breast cancer in the preserved breast. Conclusion IEFSA is useful for preventing the need for re-operation and local recurrence after BCS.},

Neuromagnetic field patterns were recorded as participants listened to a 1 kHz tone, playback of their own productions of the vowel /i/ and vowel-initial words, and actively generated the vowel /i/ and vowel-initial words. Activation of the auditory cortex at approximately 50 and 100 ms was observed during all tasks. A reduction in the peak amplitudes of the M50 and M100 components was observed during the active generation versus passive listening tasks dependent on the stimuli. Adults who stutter did not differ in the amount of speech-induced auditory suppression relative to fluent speakers. Adults who stutter had shorter M100 latencies for the actively generated speaking tasks in the right hemisphere relative to the left hemisphere but the fluent speakers showed similar latencies across hemispheres. During passive listening tasks, adults who stutter had longer M50 and M100 latencies than fluent speakers. The results suggest that there are timing, rather than amplitude, differences in auditory processing during speech in adults who stutter and are discussed in relation to hypotheses of auditory-motor integration breakdown in stuttering.},

As early as 24 hours after treatment with clinically relevant anticancer drugs, the optical metabolic imaging index of responsive organoids decreased (P {\textless} 0.001) and was further reduced when effective therapies were combined (P {\textless} 5 × 10−6), with no change in drug-resistant organoids.

	abstract = {Purpose: To assess, if and for whom, there are cost savings associated with alternate breast radiotherapy (RT) techniques when compared with the conventional external beam-based whole-breast RT with a boost (WBRT-B).

Methods and Materials: Treatment planning and delivery utilization data were modeled for eight different breast RT techniques: (1) WBRT-B: 60 Gy in 30 fractions; (2) WBRT: 50 Gy in 25 fractions; (3) WBRT-accelerated (AC): 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions; (4) WBRT-intensity-modulated RT (IMRT): 60 Gy in 30 fractions; (5) accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)-IC, MammoSite: 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; (6) APBI-IT, HDR interstitial: 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; (7) APBI three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT): 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; or (8) APBI-IMRT: 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions. Costs incurred by payer (i.e., direct medical costs; 2003 Medicare Fee Schedule) and patient (i.e., direct nonmedical costs; time and travel) were estimated. Total societal costs were then calculated for each treatment approach.

Results: Not all efforts to reduce overall treatment time result in total cost savings. The least expensive partial breast-based RT approaches were the external beam techniques (APBI-3D-CRT, APBI-IMRT). Any reduced cost to patients for the HDR brachytherapy-based APBI regimens were overshadowed by substantial increases in cost to payers, resulting in higher total societal costs; the cost of HDR treatment delivery was primarily responsible for the increased direct medical cost. For the whole breast-based RT approaches, treating without a boost (WBRT) or with WBRT-AC reduced total costs. Overall, WBRT-AC was the least costly of all the regimens, in terms of costs to society; APBI approaches, in general, were favored over whole-breast techniques when only considering costs to patients.

Conclusions: Based on societal cost considerations, WBRT-AC appears to be the preferred approach. If one were to pursue a partial-breast RT regimen to minimize patient costs, it would be more advantageous from a societal perspective to pursue external beam-based approaches such as APBI-3D-CRT or APBI-IMRT in lieu of the brachytherapy-based regimens.},

	abstract = {We studied the effect of cyclic mechanical stretching on the proliferation and collagen mRNA expression and protein production of human patellar tendon fibroblasts under serum-free conditions. The role of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in collagen production by cyclically stretched tendon fibroblasts was also investigated. The tendon fibroblasts were grown in microgrooved silicone dishes, where the cells were highly elongated and aligned with the microgrooves. Cyclic uniaxial stretching with constant frequency and duration (0.5 Hz, 4 h) but varying magnitude of stretch (no stretch, 4\%, and 8\%) was applied to the silicone dishes. Following the period of stretching, the cells were rested for 20 h in stretching-conditioned medium to allow for cell proliferation. In separate experiments, the cells were stretched for 4 h and then rested for another 4 h. Samples of the medium, total cellular RNA and protein were used for analysis of collagen and TGF-β1 gene expression and production. It was found that there was a slight increase in fibroblast proliferation at 4\% and 8\% stretch, compared to that of non-stretched fibroblasts, where at 8\% stretch the increase was significant. It was also found that the gene expression and protein production of collagen type I and TGF-β1 increased in a stretching-magnitude-dependent manner. And, levels of collagen type III were not changed, despite gene expression levels of the protein being slightly increased. Furthermore, the exogenous addition of anti-TGF-β1 antibody eliminated the increase in collagen type I production under cyclic uniaxial stretching conditions. The results suggest that mechanical stretching can modulate proliferation of human tendon fibroblasts in the absence of serum and increase the cellular production of collagen type I, which is at least in part mediated by TGF-β1.},

In prostate cancer (CaP) there appears to be early ({\textless}50 years) versus late ({\textgreater}60 years) onset clinically significant cancers, and we have yet to clearly understand the hereditary and somatic-based molecular pathways involved. We do know that once cancer is initiated, dedifferentiation of the prostate gland occurs with significant changes in nuclear structure driven by numerous genetic and epigenetic processes. This review focuses upon the nuclear architecture and epigenetic dynamics with potential translational clinically relevant applications to CaP. Further, the review correlates changes in the cancer-driven epigenetic process at the molecular level and correlates these alterations to nuclear morphological quantitative measurements.

	abstract = {Muscle fiber images play an important role in the medical diagnosis and treatment of many muscular diseases. The number of nuclei in skeletal muscle fiber images is a key bio-marker of the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. In nuclei segmentation one primary challenge is to correctly separate the clustered nuclei. In this article, we developed an image processing pipeline to automatically detect, segment, and analyze nuclei in microscopic image of muscle fibers. The pipeline consists of image pre-processing, identification of isolated nuclei, identification and segmentation of clustered nuclei, and quantitative analysis. Nuclei are initially extracted from background by using local Otsu's threshold. Based on analysis of morphological features of the isolated nuclei, including their areas, compactness, and major axis lengths, a Bayesian network is trained and applied to identify isolated nuclei from clustered nuclei and artifacts in all the images. Then a two-step refined watershed algorithm is applied to segment clustered nuclei. After segmentation, the nuclei can be quantified for statistical analysis. Comparing the segmented results with those of manual analysis and an existing technique, we find that our proposed image processing pipeline achieves good performance with high accuracy and precision. The presented image processing pipeline can therefore help biologists increase their throughput and objectivity in analyzing large numbers of nuclei in muscle fiber images.},

	abstract = {Background Re-excision is common in breast-conserving surgery (BCS), partly due to lack of consensus on margin definitions. A population-based surgeon sample was used to determine current attitudes toward margin width and identify characteristics associated with margin choice. Methods Breast cancer patients treated from 2005 to 2007 were identified from Los Angeles and Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. Pathology reports were used to identify their surgeons, who were surveyed (n = 418). Response rate was 74.6\% (n = 312). Mean surgeon age was 51.9 years, 17.8\% were female, and mean number of years in practice was 18.5. Results Wide variation in margin selection was noted among surgeons, and did not differ for invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In a scenario of T1 invasive cancer, 11\% of surgeons endorsed margins of tumor not touching ink (TNTI), 42\% of 1–2 mm, 28\% of ≥5 mm, and 19\% {\textgreater}1 cm as precluding need for re-excision before radiotherapy. On multivariate analysis, having 50\% or more of practice devoted to breast cancer independently predicted smaller margin choice (p = 0.03). For a patient with a 1.4-cm grade 2 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive DCIS without radiotherapy (RT) planned, 3\% of surgeons chose TNTI, 12\% 1–2 mm, 25\% ≥5 mm, and 61\% {\textgreater}1 cm as sufficient without re-excision. In the scenario of DCIS without RT, breast specialization independently predicted larger margin choice (p = 0.03). Gender and years in practice were not predictive of margin choice. Conclusions Wide variation in BCS margin definition exists. Variation is similar for invasive cancer and DCIS with RT, with more specialized surgeons choosing smaller margins. In DCIS without RT, more specialized surgeons favored larger margins. A standardized margin definition may significantly affect re-excision rates.},

	abstract = {In this issue of the Journal , Jorns et al1 report that intraoperative frozen section examination of breast lumpectomy margins was associated with a substantial reduction in the rate of reexcision. In their retrospective study, at some time after the initial lumpectomy a reexcision was performed in 48.9\% of patients who did not have frozen section margin evaluation compared with only 14.9\% of those in whom frozen section evaluation of the margins was performed. Further, these investigators developed a technique to overcome the methodological difficulties of attempting to cut frozen sections of fatty tissue such as margins of breast specimens. So if it is now technically feasible to obtain adequate frozen sections from lumpectomy margins and if intraoperative frozen section evaluations of these margins can reduce the need for a subsequent reexcision by almost 70\%, should pathologists the world over be gearing up to routinely freeze margins of breast lumpectomy specimens? To answer this question, we must first review some fundamental data on lumpectomy margins and their association with local recurrence, and put these data into current clinical context.

Various patient factors, treatment factors, and pathologic factors have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence in the ipsilateral breast (local recurrence) after breast-conserving treatment for invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Arguably the most important of these is the status of the microscopic margins of excision of the resected breast specimen. Positive margins (ie, invasive carcinoma or DCIS at an inked tissue edge) have consistently been associated with a higher risk of local recurrence than negative margins.2 Therefore, obtaining negative margins is the primary goal of breast-conserving surgery. Unfortunately, there is far from universal agreement as to what constitutes an adequate negative margin. In fact, results of surveys of surgeons and …},

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of intraoperative margin assessment in obtaining clear margins in conserving surgery for breast cancer.

Methods: Two hundred and twenty patients undergoing wide local excision (WLE) for core biopsy proven primary invasive breast cancer, during a 30 months period, were included in the study. Following surgical excision the breast specimen was orientated with sutures, inked using India ink and coloured pigments and incised to identify the tumour, maintaining orientation. The distance to the individual radial margins were estimated macroscopically by the pathologist and conveyed intraoperatively to the surgeon. A macroscopic tumour-margin distance of less than 10 mm was considered compromised and the margin(s) in question was then excised if feasible.

Results: Eighty-one patients (37\%) were judged to have compromised margins following intraoperative macroscopic evaluation and had at least one margin re-excised. Sixteen of the 81 patients (20\%) in this subgroup had compromised margins on microscopy and required a second operation. One hundred and thirty-nine patients (63\%) were deemed to have clear margins intraoperatively, subsequently confirmed on microscopic examination in 135 patients (97\%). Intraoperative macroscopic assessment of margin status was associated with 9.1\% of patients requiring a second operation. In the absence of intraoperative assessment of margin status a further 47 patients (21.4\%) would have required a second operation.

Conclusion: Intraoperative macroscopic margin assessment is an effective technique in reducing the number of second operative procedures in patients undergoing conserving surgery for primary invasive breast cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The randomized trials comparing breast-conserving therapy (BCT), i.e., surgery and radiation to the breast, with mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer use a variety of protocols. Meta-analysis may assist in understanding the impact of these differences on survival.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible variations of the relative efficacy of BCT and mastectomy in terms of overall survival according to tumor size, nodal status, and use of adjuvant radiation therapy.
METHODS: The most recent published results and, where available, updated patient-level data from randomized controlled trials of BCT and mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer were combined in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Pooled survival rates and odds ratios were generated according to subgroups of nodal status and tumor size. Five- and 10-year odds ratios were also determined according to adjuvant radiation protocol.
RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio comparing 10-year survival for BCT and mastectomy was 0.91. The odds ratios comparing the two treatment regimens were not significant after grouping according to tumor size and nodal status. When more than 50\% of node-positive patients in both the mastectomy and BCT arms received adjuvant radiation, both arms had similar survival rates. When less than 50\% of node-positive patients in both arms received adjuvant nodal radiation, the odds ratio was 0.69, and patients receiving BCT had a survival advantage.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients allocated to BCT have survival rates at least as high as patients allocated to mastectomy. When all protocols were combined, nodal status and tumor size did not significantly alter the relative survival rates. However, under some conditions, particularly for node-positive patients, BCT may confer a relative survival advantage over mastectomy. In particular, mastectomy without adjuvant radiation appears to be inferior to BCT for node-positive patients.},

In this study, we present the first implementation of Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging in 3D based on the use of either diverging or plane waves emanating from a sparse virtual array located behind the probe. It achieves high contrast and resolution while maintaining imaging rates of thousands of volumes per second. A customized portable ultrasound system was developed to sample 1024 independent channels and to drive a 32  ×  32 matrix-array probe. Its ability to track in 3D transient phenomena occurring in the millisecond range within a single ultrafast acquisition was demonstrated for 3D Shear-Wave Imaging, 3D Ultrafast Doppler Imaging, and, finally, 3D Ultrafast combined Tissue and Flow Doppler Imaging. The propagation of shear waves was tracked in a phantom and used to characterize its stiffness. 3D Ultrafast Doppler was used to obtain 3D maps of Pulsed Doppler, Color Doppler, and Power Doppler quantities in a single acquisition and revealed, at thousands of volumes per second, the complex 3D flow patterns occurring in the ventricles of the human heart during an entire cardiac cycle, as well as the 3D in vivo interaction of blood flow and wall motion during the pulse wave in the carotid at the bifurcation. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging for the 3D mapping of stiffness, tissue motion, and flow in humans in vivo and promises new clinical applications of ultrasound with reduced intra--and inter-observer variability.},

Alternative models of programmed cell death (PCD) have therefore been proposed, including autophagy, paraptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and the descriptive model of apoptosis-like and necrosis-like PCD. Caspase-independent cell death pathways are important safeguard mechanisms to protect the organism against unwanted and potential harmful cells when caspase-mediated routes fail but can also be triggered in response to cytotoxic agents or other death stimuli. As in apoptosis, the mitochondrion can play a key role but also other organelles such as lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum have an important function in the release and activation of death factors such as cathepsins, calpains, and other proteases. Here we review the various models of PCD and their death pathways at molecular and organelle level and discuss the relevance of the growing knowledge of caspase-independent cell death pathways for cancer.},

	abstract = {Mechanical forces are closely involved in the construction of an embryo. Experiments have suggested that mechanical feedback plays a role in regulating these forces, but the nature of this feedback is poorly understood. Here, we propose a general principle for the mechanics of morphogenesis, as governed by a pair of evolution equations based on feedback from tissue stress. In one equation, the rate of growth (or contraction) depends on the difference between the current tissue stress and a target (homeostatic) stress. In the other equation, the target stress changes at a rate that depends on the same stress difference. The parameters in these morphomechanical laws are assumed to depend on stress rate. Computational models are used to illustrate how these equations can capture a relatively wide range of behaviours observed in developing embryos, as well as show the limitations of this theory. Specific applications include growth of pressure vessels (e.g. the heart, arteries and brain), wound healing and sea urchin gastrulation. Understanding the fundamental principles of tissue construction can help engineers design new strategies for creating replacement tissues and organs in vitro.},

In vivo interactions of biglycan and fibromodulin, two SLRPs highly expressed in tendons and bones, were investigated by generating biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice. Here we show that collagen fibrils in tendons from mice deficient in biglycan and/or fibromodulin are structurally and mechanically altered resulting in unstable joints. As a result, the mice develop successively and progressively 1) gait impairment, 2) ectopic tendon ossification, and 3) severe premature osteoarthritis. Forced use of the joints increases ectopic ossification and osteoarthritis in the double-deficient mice, further indicating that structurally weak tendons cause the phenotype. The study shows that mutations in SLRPs may predispose to osteoarthritis and offers a valuable and unique animal model for spontaneous osteoarthritis characterized by early onset and a rapid progression of the disease—Ameye, L., Aria, D., Jepsen, K., Oldberg, A., Xu, T., Young, M.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We set out to examine the activity of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in lung cancer and the validity of γ-glutamyl hydroxymethyl rhodamine green (gGlu-HMRG) for intraoperative imaging of primary lung cancer. METHODS: GGT activities and mRNA expression levels of GGT1 (one of the GGT subtypes) in five human lung cancer cell lines were examined by fluorescence imaging and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo imaging of an orthotopic A549 xenograft model in nude mice was performed to confirm its applicability to intraoperative imaging. Furthermore, ex vivo imaging of 73 specimens from lung cancer patients were performed and analyzed to calculate the sensitivity/specificity of gGlu-HMRG for lung cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: GGT activities and mRNA expression levels of GGT1 are diverse depending on cell type; A549, H441, and H460 showed relatively high GGT activities and expression levels, whereas H82 and H226 showed lower values. In the in vivo mouse model study, tiny pleural dissemination and hilar/mediastinal lymph node metastasis (less than 1 mm in diameter) were clearly detected 15 minutes after topical application of gGlu-HMRG. In the ex vivo study of specimens from patients, the sensitivity and specificity of gGlu-HMRG were calculated to be 43.8\% (32/73) and 84.9\% (62/73), respectively. When limited to female patients, never smokers, and adenocarcinomas, these values were 78.9\% (15/19) and 73.7\% (14/19), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although GGT activity of lung cancer cells vary, gGlu-HMRG can serve as an intraoperative imaging tool to detect small foci of lung cancer when such cells have sufficient GGT activity.},

	abstract = {The standard approach to breast-conserving surgery is wide local excision of the tumor and radiotherapy. However, a significant number of patients require further surgery to obtain oncologically clear margins, and may obtain a poor cosmetic result following adjuvant radiotherapy. Oncoplastic techniques may result in improved cosmesis, but few studies have investigated the oncological advantage of this approach. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare tumor clearance and the need for further margin excision following standard wide local excision (group A, 121 patients), and oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery (group B, 37 patients). These techniques included therapeutic mammoplasty, sub-axillary fat pad rotation mammoplasty, thoraco-epigastric flap, and central flap. Compared to standard surgery (group A), oncoplastic techniques (group B) can be employed for significantly larger tumors (17.6 mm versus 23.9 mm, p = 0.002). Oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery results in higher mean specimen weights (58.1 g versus 231.1 g, p {\textless} 0.0001), higher specimen volumes (112.3 cm3 versus 484.5 cm3, p {\textless} 0.0001), and wider clear margins (6.1 mm versus 14.3 mm, p {\textless} 0.0001), resulting in lower rates of further surgery (28.9\% versus 5.4\%, p = 0.002). There was no statistical increase in complication rates following oncoplastic surgery. Oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery is more successful than standard wide local excision in treating larger tumors and obtaining wider radial margins, thus reducing the need for further margin excision, which delays adjuvant therapy. There was no increase in postoperative complication rate using an oncoplastic approach.},

	abstract = {Background: The definition of a negative surgical margin in prospective randomized trials of breast conserving surgery (BCS) is ‘no tumour at ink’ with no conclusive evidence that wider margins of 1mm, 2mm or 5mm are essential for optimal outcomes in the era of modern radiotherapy techniques and systemic therapy. Our group have previously shown that residual tumour is present in only 6\% of specimens when re-excision is prompted by a margin of 2 – 5mm compared with 40\% for when primary tumour margins are ≤2mm. An audit was undertaken to determine the effect of a change in margin mandate from 5mm to 2mm on rates of re-excision and residual disease in re-excision specimens.
Methods: Data were collected retrospectively from 410 women undergoing BCS for symptomatic and screen-detected invasive and non-invasive disease between November 1st 2009 and October 31st 2011. Rates of re-excision and residual disease in re-excision specimens were compared for 215 patients in the 12 months immediately before (Group 1) and 195 patients in a similar time period after (Group 2) a change in margin policy. All impalpable lesions had conventional intra-operative specimen imaging. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test.
Results: Amongst these 410 BCS patients, there were similar proportions of symptomatic and screen-detected cases in each group, but slightly more wire-localized procedures in group 2 (59.5\% versus 48.4\%; p = 0.029). Rates of patient re-excision were 21.9\% (47/215) for group 1 and 25.6\% (50/195) for group 2 with no significant difference between margin mandates of 5mm and 2mm respectively (p = 0.42). Eleven patients in each group had a completion mastectomy with 6 and 4 patients in Groups 1 and 2 respectively undergoing {\textgreater}1 re-excision. There was a trend for an increased proportion of residual disease following a change in margin policy (30.2\% group 1, 40.7\% Group2; p = 0.32) and the majority of re-excision cases had ductal carcinoma in situ alone or combined with invasive cancer in the primary specimen ({\textgreater}80\%). There was no significant difference in the proportion of wire-localizations for all re-excisions (≥1) between Group 1 (31/42 = 74\%) and Group 2 (25/43 = 58\%) (p = 0.17).
Conclusion: A reduction in target surgical margin width from 5mm to 2mm has not decreased rates of re-excision but yields a trend towards an increase in proportion of specimens with residual disease. Longer follow up is required to assess rates of local control and further analyses will ascertain whether a less stringent margin policy is more appropriate for contemporary BCS where adjuvant treatments contribute to local control.

	abstract = {Abstract:  Whether cosmetically acceptable tumor-free (≥2 mm) surgical margins reduce the local-regional recurrence risk for patients treated with fractionated radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy is unknown. The benefit of a minimum cosmetically acceptable tumor-free margin remains speculative because no contemporary studies have investigated the extent of invasive disease infiltration within the breast beyond the primary tumor. To address these clinical issues, we conducted a retrospective study of 341 women diagnosed with stage I or II invasive breast cancer to determine the rate of local in-breast, elsewhere in-breast, and ipsilateral regional lymph node recurrences of breast cancer after conservation surgery achieving either tumor-free (≥2 mm) or close ({\textgreater}0 mm to {\textless}2 mm) surgical margins followed by whole breast radiation therapy over a 6-year period from January 1996 to December 2002. Women may have received adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy as clinically indicated. After a median follow-up of 56 months from the completion of breast conservation surgery, 14 of the 341 women (4.1\%) developed breast cancer recurrences. Crude ipsilateral recurrence rates were 1.8\% (4 of 222) for tumor-free (≥2 mm) versus 8.4\% (10 of 119) for close ({\textgreater}0 mm to {\textless}2 mm) surgical margins (p = 0.007). The estimated 5-year cumulative local recurrence rate was significantly less for women with tumor-free margins (2.1\%) as compared to close surgical margins (8.9\%) (p = 0.004). Multivariate analyses identified negative estrogen receptor expression (p = 0.004), close surgical margins (p = 0.012), and the presence of angiolymphatic invasion (p = 0.040) as prognostic factors for local-regional recurrences. Microscopically the extent of invasive disease infiltration beyond the primary tumor was on average 1 mm, with all measured invasive disease less than 1 cm. Based on our findings, cosmetically acceptable tumor-free (≥2 mm) surgical margins significantly reduce local in-breast and regional lymph node recurrences with fractionated radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.},

EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive ‘pop’ functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A ‘plug-in’ facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu.

Approximately 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,620 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2013. One in 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. Breast cancer incidence rates increased slightly among African American women; decreased among Hispanic women; and were stable among whites, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives from 2006 to 2010. Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older; however, incidence rates are converging among white and African American women, particularly among women aged 50 years to 59 years. Incidence rates increased for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in the youngest white women, Hispanic women aged 60 years to 69 years, and all but the oldest African American women. In contrast, estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers declined among most age and racial/ethnic groups. These divergent trends may reflect etiologic heterogeneity and the differing effects of some factors, such as obesity and parity, on risk by tumor subtype. Since 1990, breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34\% and this decrease was evident in all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives. Nevertheless, survival disparities persist by race/ethnicity, with African American women having the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group. Continued progress in the control of breast cancer will require sustained and increased efforts to provide high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment to all segments of the population.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States are provided through an ongoing collaboration among the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). This annual report highlights the increasing burden of liver and intrahepatic bile duct (liver) cancers.


METHODS

Cancer incidence data were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR; data about cancer deaths were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992-2012 and mortality for 1975-2012) and short-term trends (2008-2012). In-depth analysis of liver cancer incidence included an age-period-cohort analysis and an incidence-based estimation of person-years of life lost because of the disease. By using NCHS multiple causes of death data, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and liver cancer-associated death rates were examined from 1999 through 2013.


RESULTS

Among men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups, death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined and for most cancer sites; the overall cancer death rate (for both sexes combined) decreased by 1.5\% per year from 2003 to 2012. Overall, incidence rates decreased among men and remained stable among women from 2003 to 2012. Among both men and women, deaths from liver cancer increased at the highest rate of all cancer sites, and liver cancer incidence rates increased sharply, second only to thyroid cancer. Men had more than twice the incidence rate of liver cancer than women, and rates increased with age for both sexes. Among non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, and Hispanic men and women, liver cancer incidence rates were higher for persons born after the 1938 to 1947 birth cohort. In contrast, there was a minimal birth cohort effect for NH Asian and Pacific Islanders (APIs). NH black men and Hispanic men had the lowest median age at death (60 and 62 years, respectively) and the highest average person-years of life lost per death (21 and 20 years, respectively) from liver cancer. HCV and liver cancer-associated death rates were highest among decedents who were born during 1945 through 1965.


CONCLUSIONS

Overall, cancer incidence and mortality declined among men; and, although cancer incidence was stable among women, mortality declined. The burden of liver cancer is growing and is not equally distributed throughout the population. Efforts to vaccinate populations that are vulnerable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and to identify and treat those living with HCV or HBV infection, metabolic conditions, alcoholic liver disease, or other causes of cirrhosis can be effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of liver cancer.

Accredited breast centers in the United States are measured on performance of breast conservation surgery (BCS) in the majority of women with early-stage breast cancer. Prior research in regional and limited national cohorts suggests a recent shift toward increasing performance of mastectomy in patients eligible for BCS.Objective
To examine whether mastectomy rates in patients eligible for BCS are increasing over time nationwide, and are associated with coincident increases in breast reconstruction and bilateral mastectomy for unilateral disease.Design, Setting, and Participants
We performed a retrospective cohort study of temporal trends in performance of mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer using multivariable logistic regression modeling to adjust for pertinent covariates and interactions. We studied more than 1.2 million adult women treated at centers accredited by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2011, using the National Cancer Data Base.Exposures
Year of breast cancer diagnosis.Main Outcomes and Measures
Proportion of women with early-stage breast cancer who underwent mastectomy. Secondary outcome measures include temporal trends in breast reconstruction and bilateral mastectomy for unilateral disease.Results
A total of 35.5\% of the study cohort underwent mastectomy. The adjusted odds of mastectomy in BCS-eligible women increased 34\% during the most recent 8 years of the cohort, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95\% CI, 1.31-1.38) in 2011 relative to 2003. Rates of increase were greatest in women with clinically node-negative disease (odds ratio, 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.34-1.41) and in situ disease (odds ratio, 2.05; 95\% CI, 1.95-2.15). In women undergoing mastectomy, rates of breast reconstruction increased from 11.6\% in 1998 to 36.4\% in 2011 (P {\textless} .001 for trend). Rates of bilateral mastectomy for unilateral disease increased from 1.9\% in 1998 to 11.2\% in 2011 (P {\textless} .001).Conclusions and Relevance
In the past decade, there have been marked trends toward higher proportions of BCS-eligible patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction, and bilateral mastectomy. The greatest increases are seen in women with node-negative and in situ disease. Mastectomy rates do not yet exceed current American Cancer Society/American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer accreditation benchmarks. Further research is needed to understand factors associated with these trends and their implications for performance measurement in American Cancer Society/American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer centers.},

Most current immunization procedures are obtained by parenteral injection and only few vaccines are administered by mucosal route, because of its low efficiency. However, targeting of mucosal compartments to induce protective immunity at both mucosal sites and systemic level represents a great challenge. Major efforts are made to develop new mucosal candidate vaccines by selecting appropriate antigens with high immunogenicity, designing new mucosal routes of administration and selecting immune-stimulatory adjuvant molecules. The aim of mucosal vaccines is to induce broad potent protective immunity by specific neutralizing antibodies at mucosal surfaces and by induction of cellular immunity. Moreover, an efficient mucosal vaccine would make immunization procedures easier and be better suited for mass administration. This review focuses on contemporary developments of mucosal vaccination approaches using different routes of administration.},

Although white blood cells (WBCs) with giant nuclei are the main symptom of leukemia, they are not sufficient to prove this disease and other symptoms must be investigated. For example another important symptom of leukemia is the existence of nucleolus in nucleus. The nucleus contains chromatin and a structure called the nucleolus. Chromatin is DNA in its active form while nucleolus is composed of protein and RNA, which are usually inactive. In this paper, to diagnose this symptom and in order to discriminate between nucleoli and chromatins, we employ curvelet transform, which is a multiresolution transform for detecting 2D singularities in images. For this reason, at first nuclei are extracted by means of K-means method, then curvelet transform is applied on extracted nuclei and the coefficients are modified, and finally reconstructed image is used to extract the candidate locations of chromatins and nucleoli. This method is applied on 100 microscopic images and succeeds with specificity of 80.2\% and sensitivity of 84.3\% to detect the nucleolus candidate zone. After nucleolus candidate zone detection, new features that can be used to classify atypical and blast cells such as gradient of saturation channel are extracted.},

We sought to establish the feasibility of video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) of the intact removed tumor surface as a practical and non-destructive alternative to intra-operative frozen section pathology, using prostate cancer as an initial target. We present the first images of the intact human prostate surface obtained with pathologically-relevant contrast and subcellular detail, obtained in 24 radical prostatectomy specimens immediately after excision. We demonstrate that it is feasible to routinely image the full prostate circumference, generating gigapixel panorama images of the surface that are readily interpreted by pathologists. VR-SIM confirmed detection of positive surgical margins in 3 out of 4 prostates with pathology-confirmed adenocarcinoma at the circumferential surgical margin, and furthermore detected extensive residual cancer at the circumferential margin in a case post-operatively classified by histopathology as having negative surgical margins. Our results suggest that the increased surface coverage of VR-SIM could also provide added value for detection and characterization of positive surgical margins over traditional histopathology.},

	abstract = {Tumour grade (a measure of the degree of cellular differentiation of malignant neoplasm) is an important prognostic factor in many types of cancer. In general, poorly differentiated tumours are characterized by a higher degree of architectural irregularity and complexity of histological structures. Fractal dimension is a useful parameter for characterizing complex irregular structures. However, one of the difficulties of estimating the fractal dimension from microscopic images is the segmentation of pathologically relevant structures for analysis. A commonly used technique to segment structures of interest is to apply a pixel intensity threshold to convert the original image to binary and extract pixel outline structures from the binary representation. The difficulty with this approach is that the value of the threshold required to segment the histological structures is highly dependent on the staining technique chosen and imaging conditions (i.e., illumination time, intensity, and uniformity) of the microscopic system. In this work, we present a method for finding the optimal intensity threshold by maximizing the corresponding fractal dimension. This method results in the segmentation of histological structures and the estimation of their fractal dimension (independent of imaging conditions). We applied our technique to 164 prostate histology sections from 82 prostate core biopsy specimens (two serial sections from each of the 63 benign prostate tissues and 19 high grade prostate carcinoma). We stained one of the serial sections with conventional hemotoxylin and eosin (H\&amp;E) and the other with pan-keratin, and found that the difference in mean fractal dimension between the two groups was statistically significant (p \&lt; 0.0001) for both stains. However, using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, we conclude that our fractal dimension method applied to the images of pan-keratin stained sections provides greater classification performance (benign versus high grade) than with those stained with H\&amp;E when compared to the original histological diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity achieved with the pan-keratin images were 89.5\% and 90.5\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background

Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) of malignant melanoma (MM) has been advocated to help clinicians to achieve a more objective and reliable assessment. However, conventional CAD systems examine only the features extracted from digital photographs of lesions. Failure to incorporate patients' personal information constrains the applicability in clinical settings.


Objectives

To develop a new CAD system to improve the performance of automatic diagnosis of melanoma, which, for the first time, incorporates digital features of lesions with important patient metadata into a learning process.


Methods

Thirty-two features were extracted from digital photographs to characterize skin lesions. Patients' personal information, such as age, gender and, lesion site, and their combinations, was quantified as metadata. The integration of digital features and metadata was realized through an extended Laplacian eigenmap, a dimensionality-reduction method grouping lesions with similar digital features and metadata into the same classes.


Results

The diagnosis reached 82·1\% sensitivity and 86·1\% specificity when only multidimensional digital features were used, but improved to 95·2\% sensitivity and 91·0\% specificity after metadata were incorporated appropriately. The proposed system achieves a level of sensitivity comparable with experienced dermatologists aided by conventional dermoscopes. This demonstrates the potential of our method for assisting clinicians in diagnosing melanoma, and the benefit it could provide to patients and hospitals by greatly reducing unnecessary excisions of benign naevi.


Conclusions

This paper proposes an enhanced CAD system incorporating clinical metadata into the learning process for automatic classification of melanoma. Results demonstrate that the additional metadata and the mechanism to incorporate them are useful for improving CAD of melanoma.},

Optical properties (absorption, µa, and scattering, µs′, parameters) derived from FDPM measurements can be used to construct low-resolution (0.5 to 1 cm) functional images of tissue hemoglobin (total, oxy-, and deoxyforms), oxygen saturation, blood volume fraction, water content, fat content and cellular structure. Unlike conventional NIR transillumination, FDPM enables quantitative analysis of tissue absorption and scattering parameters in a single non-invasive measurement. The unique functional information provided by FDPM makes it well-suited to characterizing tumors in thick tissues. In order to test the sensitivity of FDPM for cancer diagnosis, we have initiated clinical studies to quantitatively determine normal and malignant breast tissue optical and physiological properties in human subjects. Measurements are performed using a non-invasive, multi-wavelength, diode-laser FDPM device optimized for clinical studies. Results show that ductal carcinomas (invasive and in situ) and benign fibroadenomas exhibit 1.25 to 3-fold higher absorption than normal breast tissue. Within this group, absorption is greatest for measurements obtained from sites of invasive cancer. Optical scattering is approximately 20\% greater in pre-menopausal versus post-menopausal subjects due to differences in gland/cell proliferation and collagen/fat content. Spatial variations in tissue scattering reveal the loss of differentiation associated with breast disease progression. Overall, the metabolic demands of hormonal stimulation and tumor growth are detectable using photon migration techniques. Measurements provide quantitative optical property values that reflect changes in tissue perfusion, oxygen consumption, and cell/matrix development.},

	abstract = {As many as 20-70\% of patients undergoing breast conserving surgery require repeat surgeries due to a close or positive surgical margin diagnosed post-operatively [1]. Currently there are no widely accepted tools for intra-operative margin assessment which is a significant unmet clinical need. Our group has developed a first-generation optical visible spectral imaging platform to image the molecular composition of breast tumor margins and has tested it clinically in 48 patients in a previously published study [2]. The goal of this paper is to report on the performance metrics of the system and compare it to clinical criteria for intra-operative tumor margin assessment. The system was found to have an average signal to noise ratio (SNR) {\textgreater}100 and {\textless}15\% error in the extraction of optical properties indicating that there is sufficient SNR to leverage the differences in optical properties between negative and close/positive margins. The probe had a sensing depth of 0.5-2.2 mm over the wavelength range of 450-600 nm which is consistent with the pathologic criterion for clear margins of 0-2 mm. There was {\textless}1\% cross-talk between adjacent channels of the multi-channel probe which shows that multiple sites can be measured simultaneously with negligible cross-talk between adjacent sites. Lastly, the system and measurement procedure were found to be reproducible when evaluated with repeated measures, with a low coefficient of variation ({\textless}0.11). The only aspect of the system not optimized for intra-operative use was the imaging time. The manuscript includes a discussion of how the speed of the system can be improved to work within the time constraints of an intra-operative setting.},

	abstract = {β-arrestins 1 and 2 are multifunctional adaptor proteins originally discovered for their role in desensitizing seven-transmembrane receptor signaling via the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Recently identified roles of β-arrestins include regulation of cancer cell chemotaxis and proliferation. Herein we report that β-arrestin1 expression regulates breast tumor colonization in nude mice and cancer cell viability during hypoxia. β-arrestin1 robustly interacts with nuclear hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF-1α) that is stabilized during hypoxia and potentiates HIF-1-dependent transcription of the angiogenic factor VEGF-A. Increased expression of β-arrestin1 in human breast cancer (infiltrating ductal carcinoma or IDC and metastatic IDC) correlates with increased levels of VEGF-A. While the anti-angiogenic drug thalidomide inhibits HIF-1-dependent VEGF transcription in breast carcinoma cells, it does not prevent HIF-1α stabilization, but leads to aberrant localization of HIF-1α to the perinuclear compartments and surprisingly stimulates nuclear export of β-arrestin1. Additionally, imatinib mesylate that inhibits release of VEGF induces nuclear export of β-arrestin1-HIF-1α complexes. Our findings suggest that β-arrestin1 regulates nuclear signaling during hypoxia to promote survival of breast cancer cells via VEGF signaling and that drugs that induce its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm could be useful in anti-angiogenic and breast cancer therapies.},

Although the definition of LABC can be broadened to include some large operable breast tumours, we use this term to strictly refer to inoperable cancers that are included in the above-mentioned categories. The prognosis of such tumours is often unfavourable; despite aggressive treatment, many patients eventually develop distant metastases and die from the disease. Advances in systemic therapy, including radiation treatment, surgical techniques and the development of new targeted agents have significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with this disease. Notwithstanding these advances, LABC remains an important clinical problem, particularly in developing countries and those without widely adapted breast cancer awareness programmes. The optimal management of LABC requires a multidisciplinary approach, a well-coordinated treatment schedule and close cooperation between medical, surgical and radiation oncologists. In this Review, we discuss the current state of the art and possible future treatment strategies for patients with LABC.},

	abstract = {Gleason patterns of prostate cancer histopathology, characterized primarily by morphological and architectural attributes of histological structures (glands and nuclei), have been found to be highly correlated with disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. Gleason patterns 4 and 5 are highly correlated with more aggressive disease and poorer patient outcome, while Gleason patterns 1–3 tend to reflect more favorable patient outcome. Because Gleason grading is done manually by a pathologist visually examining glass (or digital) slides subtle morphologic and architectural differences of histological attributes, in addition to other factors, may result in grading errors and hence cause high inter-observer variability. Recently some researchers have proposed computerized decision support systems to automatically grade Gleason patterns by using features pertaining to nuclear architecture, gland morphology, as well as tissue texture. Automated characterization of gland morphology has been shown to distinguish between intermediate Gleason patterns 3 and 4 with high accuracy. Manifold learning (ML) schemes attempt to generate a low dimensional manifold representation of a higher dimensional feature space while simultaneously preserving nonlinear relationships between object instances. Classification can then be performed in the low dimensional space with high accuracy. However ML is sensitive to the samples contained in the dataset; changes in the dataset may alter the manifold structure. In this paper we present a manifold regularization technique to constrain the low dimensional manifold to a specific range of possible manifold shapes, the range being determined via a statistical shape model of manifolds (SSMM). In this work we demonstrate applications of the SSMM in (1) identifying samples on the manifold which contain noise, defined as those samples which deviate from the SSMM, and (2) accurate out-of-sample extrapolation (OSE) of newly acquired samples onto a manifold constrained by the SSMM. We demonstrate these applications of the SSMM in the context of distinguish between Gleason patterns 3 and 4 using glandular morphologic features in a prostate histopathology dataset of 58 patient studies. Identifying and eliminating noisy samples from the manifold via the SSMM results in a statistically significant improvement in area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.832 ± 0.048 with removal of noisy samples compared to a AUC of 0.779 ± 0.075 without removal of samples. The use of the SSMM for OSE of newly acquired glands also shows statistically significant improvement in AUC, 0.834 ± 0.051 with the SSMM compared to 0.779 ± 0.054 without the SSMM. Similar results were observed for the synthetic Swiss Roll and Helix datasets.},

Two parallel meta-analyses were carried out: (1) stuttered production in the stutterers; (2) fluent production in the control subjects. The control subjects' data replicated previous analyses of single-word reading, identifying activation in primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, Rolandic operculum, lateral cerebellum, and auditory areas, among others. The stuttering subjects' analysis showed that similar brain areas are involved in stuttered speech as in fluent speech, but with some important differences. Motor areas were over-activated in stuttering, including primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, cingulate motor area, and cerebellar vermis. Frontal operculum, Rolandic operculum, and anterior insula showed anomalous right-laterality in stutterers. Auditory activations, due to hearing one's own speech, were essentially undetectable in stutterers. The phenomenon of efference copy is proposed as a unifying account of the pattern activation revealed within this ALE meta-analysis. This provides the basis for a stuttering system model that is testable and should help to advance the understanding and treatment of this disorder.},

	abstract = {Tendon-to-bone healing following acute injury is generally poor and often fails to restore normal tendon biomechanical properties. In recent years, the murine patellar tendon (PT) has become an important model system for studying tendon healing and repair due to its genetic tractability and accessible location within the knee. However, the mechanical properties of native murine PT, specifically the regional differences in tissue strains during loading, and the biomechanical outcomes of natural PT-to-bone healing have not been well characterized. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the global biomechanical properties and regional strain patterns of both normal and naturally healing murine PT at three time points (2, 5, and 8 weeks) following acute surgical rupture of the tibial enthesis. Normal murine PT exhibited distinct regional variations in tissue strain, with the insertion region experiencing approximately 2.5 times greater strain than the midsubstance at failure (10.80±2.52\% vs. 4.11±1.40\%; mean±SEM). Injured tendons showed reduced structural (ultimate load and linear stiffness) and material (ultimate stress and linear modulus) properties compared to both normal and contralateral sham-operated tendons at all healing time points. Injured tendons also displayed increased local strain in the insertion region compared to contralateral shams at both physiologic and failure load levels. 93.3\% of injured tendons failed at the tibial insertion, compared to only 60\% and 66.7\% of normal and sham tendons, respectively. These results indicate that 8 weeks of natural tendon-to-bone healing does not restore normal biomechanical function to the murine PT following injury.},

The “instant structured illumination microscope” (iSIM) is a system designed for this purpose. Similarly to standard structured illumination microscopy (SIM), an iSIM provides a twofold improvement over widefield microscopy, in x, y and z, but also allows much faster image acquisition, with real-time display of super-resolution images.

The assembly of an iSIM is reasonably complex, involving the combination and alignment of many optical components, including three micro-optics arrays (two lenslet arrays and an array of pinholes, all with a pitch of 222 μm) and a double-sided scanning mirror. In addition, a number of electronic components must be correctly controlled. Construction of the system is therefore not trivial, but is highly desirable, particularly for live-cell imaging.

We report, and provide instructions for, the construction of an iSIM, including minor modifications to a previous design in both hardware and software. The final instrument allows us to rapidly acquire fluorescence images at rates faster than 100 fps, with approximately twofold improvement in resolution in both x–y and z; sub-diffractive biological features have an apparent size (full width at half maximum) of 145 nm (lateral) and 320 nm (axial), using a 1.49 NA objective and 488 nm excitation.},

Our preliminary results based on 93 measured locations (i.e., 34 IDC, 31 benign fibrous, 28 adipose) from 6 specimens show significant differences in 5 AFLM-derived parameters and 9 LRS-based spectral slopes between benign and malignant breast samples. Multinomial logistic regression with a 10-fold cross validation approach was implemented with selected features to classify IDC from benign fibrous and adipose tissues for the two techniques independently as well as for the combined dual-modality approach.

	abstract = {Introduction
Residual cancer following breast conserving surgery increases the risk of local recurrence and mortality. Margin assessment presents an unmet clinical need. Breast tissue is markedly heterogeneous, which makes distinguishing small foci of cancer within the spectrum of normal tissue potentially challenging. This is further complicated by the heterogeneity as a function of menopausal status. Optical spectroscopy can provide surgeons with intra-operative diagnostic tools. Here, we evaluate ex-vivo breast tissue and determine which sources of optical contrast have the potential to detect malignancy at the margins in women of differing breast composition.

Methods
Diffuse reflectance spectra were measured from 595 normal and 38 malignant sites from the margins of 104 partial mastectomy patients. All statistical tests were performed using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests. Normal and malignant sites were compared before stratifying the data by tissue type and depth and computing statistical differences. The frequencies of the normal tissue types were separated by menopausal status and compared to the corresponding optical properties.

Results
The mean reduced scattering coefficient, {\textless} μs' {\textgreater}, and concentration of total hemoglobin, [THb]), showed statistical differences between malignant ({\textless} μs' {\textgreater} : 8.96 cm-1 ± 2.24MAD, [THb]: 42.70 μM ± 29.31MAD) compared to normal sites ({\textless} μs' {\textgreater} : 7.29 cm-1 ± 2.15MAD, [THb]: 32.09 μM ± 16.73MAD) (P {\textless} 0.05). The sites stratified according to normal tissue type (fibro-glandular (FG), fibro-adipose (FA), and adipose (A)) or disease type (invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)) showed that FG exhibited increased {\textless} μs' {\textgreater} and A showed increased [β-carotene] within normal tissues. Scattering differentiated between most malignant sites, DCIS (9.46 cm-1 ± 1.06MAD) and IDC (8.00 cm-1 ± 1.81MAD), versus A (6.50 cm-1 ± 1.95MAD). [β-carotene] showed marginal differences between DCIS (19.00 μM ± 6.93MAD, and FG (15.30 μM ± 5.64MAD). [THb] exhibited statistical differences between positive sites (92.57 μM ± 18.46MAD) and FG (34.12 μM ± 22.77MAD), FA (28.63 μM ± 14.19MAD), and A (30.36 μM ± 14.86MAD). The diagnostic ability of the optical parameters was affected by distance of tumor from the margin as well as menopausal status. Due to decreased fibrous content and increased adipose content, normal sites in post-menopausal patients exhibited lower {\textless} μs' {\textgreater}, but higher [β-carotene] than pre-menopausal patients.

Conclusions
The data indicate that the ability of an optical parameter to differentiate benign from malignant breast tissues may be dictated by patient demographics.  Scattering differentiated between malignant and adipose sites and would be most effective in post-menopausal women.  [β-carotene] or [THb] may be more applicable in pre-menopausal women to differentiate malignant from fibrous sites.  Patient demographics are therefore an important component to incorporate into optical characterization of breast specimens.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite recent developments in preoperative breast cancer imaging, intraoperative localization of tumor tissue can be challenging, resulting in tumor-positive resection margins during breast conserving surgery. Based on certain physicochemical similarities between Technetium(99mTc)-sestamibi (MIBI), an SPECT radiodiagnostic with a sensitivity of 83–90\% to detect breast cancer preoperatively, and the near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore Methylene Blue (MB), we hypothesized that MB might detect breast cancer intraoperatively using NIR fluorescence imaging.
Methods
Twenty-four patients with breast cancer, planned for surgical resection, were included. Patients were divided in 2 administration groups, which differed with respect to the timing of MB administration. N = 12 patients per group were administered 1.0 mg/kg MB intravenously either immediately or 3 h before surgery. The mini-FLARE imaging system was used to identify the NIR fluorescent signal during surgery and on post-resected specimens transferred to the pathology department. Results were confirmed by NIR fluorescence microscopy.
Results
20/24 (83\%) of breast tumors (carcinoma in N = 21 and ductal carcinoma in situ in N = 3) were identified in the resected specimen using NIR fluorescence imaging. Patients with non-detectable tumors were significantly older. No significant relation to receptor status or tumor grade was seen. Overall tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) was 2.4 ± 0.8. There was no significant difference between TBR and background signal between administration groups. In 2/4 patients with positive resection margins, breast cancer tissue identified in the wound bed during surgery would have changed surgical management. Histology confirmed the concordance of fluorescence signal and tumor tissue.
Conclusions
This feasibility study demonstrated an overall breast cancer identification rate using MB of 83\%, with real-time intraoperative guidance having the potential to alter patient management.},

	abstract = {The neurophysiological basis for stuttering may involve deficits that affect dynamic interactions among neural structures supporting fluid speech processing. Here, we examined functional and structural connectivity within corticocortical and thalamocortical loops in adults who stutter. For functional connectivity, we placed seeds in the left and right inferior frontal Brodmann area 44 (BA44) and in the ventral lateral nucleus (VLN) of the thalamus. Subject-specific seeds were based on peak activation voxels captured during speech and nonspeech tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) was used to find brain regions with heightened functional connectivity with these cortical and subcortical seeds during speech and nonspeech tasks. Probabilistic tractography was used to track white matter tracts in each hemisphere using the same seeds. Both PPI and tractrography supported connectivity deficits between the left BA44 and the left premotor regions, while connectivity among homologous right hemisphere structures was significantly increased in the stuttering group. No functional connectivity differences between BA44 and auditory regions were found between groups. The functional connectivity results derived from the VLN seeds were less definitive and were not supported by the tractography results. Our data provide strongest support for deficient left hemisphere inferior frontal to premotor connectivity as a neural correlate of stuttering.},

This paper reviews our studies on the abundant non-collagenous protein, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), in equine tendons. Its variation between tendon type and site, age and exercise has provided an insight into how age and exercise influence tendon growth and maturation. Tendons can be broadly divided into two types, reflecting their different matrix composition and function: the energy-storing tendons used for weight-bearing and locomotion, which suffer a high incidence of strain-induced tendinopathy, and positional tendons involved in limb placement or manipulative skills. It would appear that while energy-storing tendon can respond to the mechanical forces applied to it during growth, there is no evidence that it can do so after skeletal maturity. Instead, cumulative fatigue damage causes degeneration at the molecular level, potentially weakening it and increasing the risk of clinical injury. Appropriate exercise regimes early in life may help to improve the quality of growing tendon, thereby reducing the incidence of injury during ageing or subsequent athletic career.},

The mitotic activity of invasive breast carcinomas may be undervalued; therefore, an evaluation of the prognostic significance of mitotic score in predicting prognosis was performed. Methods Retrospective analysis of a single institutional cohort of newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative (HER2−) unilateral invasive breast carcinomas was performed. Mitotic scores from the 3-part Nottingham combined histological grade were compared with clinical parameters. Mitoses were counted on Olympus BX50 microscopes and assigned scores of 1–3 based on observed mitoses. Results A total of 1292 ER+, HER2− invasive breast carcinoma patients were identified, with a median follow-up time of 2.6 years (range 0–14 years). Higher mitotic score was significantly associated with younger age, larger tumor size, angiolymphatic invasion, node-positive disease, higher stage, and the use of hormonal and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Mitotic score was significant in modeling time to local/regional recurrence (p = 0.02), recurrence-free survival/RFS (p {\textless} 0.001), and overall survival/OS (p = 0.01) with higher mitotic scores associated with worse outcomes. Higher mitotic score correlated significantly with intermediate/high risk Oncotype Dx recurrence scores (p = 0.009). Conclusions First-generation molecular profiling assays for estrogen receptor positive invasive breast carcinomas derive much of their predictive power from quantifying genes of proliferation into a single score. Sometimes overlooked in the profusion of molecular data, the time-tested, mitotic count in the Nottingham combined histological grade is a good single-parameter predictor of survival.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To convene a multidisciplinary panel of breast experts to examine the relationship between margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and develop a guideline for defining adequate margins in the setting of breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy.
Methods and Materials
A multidisciplinary consensus panel used a meta-analysis of margin width and IBTR from a systematic review of 33 studies including 28,162 patients as the primary evidence base for consensus.
Results
Positive margins (ink on invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ) are associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of IBTR compared with negative margins. This increased risk is not mitigated by favorable biology, endocrine therapy, or a radiation boost. More widely clear margins than no ink on tumor do not significantly decrease the rate of IBTR compared with no ink on tumor. There is no evidence that more widely clear margins reduce IBTR for young patients or for those with unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intraductal component.
Conclusions
The use of no ink on tumor as the standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer in the era of multidisciplinary therapy is associated with low rates of IBTR and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcomes, and decrease health care costs.},

Even with advanced transrectal ultrasound guidance and saturation biopsy protocols, prostate cancer can be missed in up to half of all initial biopsy procedures. In addition, collection of tumor specimens for downstream histologic, molecular, and genetic analysis is hindered by low tumor yield due to inability to identify prostate cancer grossly. However, current point-of-procedure pathology protocols, such as frozen section analysis (FSA), are destructive and too time- and labor-intensive to be practical or economical. Ex vivo microscopy of the excised specimens, stained with fast-acting fluorescent histology dyes, could be an attractive nondestructive alternative to FSA. In this work, we report the first demonstration of video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) for rapid high-resolution diagnostic imaging of prostate biopsies in realistic point-of-procedure timeframes. Large mosaic images of prostate biopsies stained with acridine orange are rendered in seconds and contain excellent contrast and detail, exhibiting close correlation with corresponding hematoxylin and eosin histology. A clinically relevant review of VR-SIM images of 34 unfixed and uncut prostate core biopsies by two independent pathologists resulted in an area under the receiver operative curve (AUC) of 0.82–0.88, with a sensitivity ranging from 63\% to 88\% and a specificity ranging from 78\% to 89\%. When biopsies contained more than 5\% tumor content, the sensitivity improved to 75\% to 92\%. The image quality, speed, minimal complexity, and ease of use of VR-SIM could prove to be features in favor of adoption as an alternative to destructive pathology at the point-of-procedure.

	abstract = {The prediction of cancer staging in prostate cancer is a process for estimating the likelihood that the cancer has spread before treatment is given to the patient. Although important for determining the most suitable treatment and optimal management strategy for patients, staging continues to present significant challenges to clinicians. Clinical test results such as the pre-treatment Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) level, the biopsy most common tumor pattern (Primary Gleason pattern) and the second most common tumor pattern (Secondary Gleason pattern) in tissue biopsies, and the clinical T stage can be used by clinicians to predict the pathological stage of cancer. However, not every patient will return abnormal results in all tests. This significantly influences the capacity to effectively predict the stage of prostate cancer. Herein we have developed a neuro-fuzzy computational intelligence model for classifying and predicting the likelihood of a patient having Organ-Confined Disease (OCD) or Extra-Prostatic Disease (ED) using a prostate cancer patient dataset obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network. The system input consisted of the following variables: Primary and Secondary Gleason biopsy patterns, PSA levels, age at diagnosis, and clinical T stage. The performance of the neuro-fuzzy system was compared to other computational intelligence based approaches, namely the Artificial Neural Network, Fuzzy C-Means, Support Vector Machine, the Naive Bayes classifiers, and also the AJCC pTNM Staging Nomogram which is commonly used by clinicians. A comparison of the optimal Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) points that were identified using these approaches, revealed that the neuro-fuzzy system, at its optimal point, returns the largest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), with a low number of false positives (FPR = 0.274, TPR = 0.789, AUC = 0.812). The proposed approach is also an improvement over the AJCC pTNM Staging Nomogram (FPR = 0.032, TPR = 0.197, AUC = 0.582).},

	abstract = {Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) became a standard surgical procedure for patients with early breast cancer; however, the optimal method of sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification remains controversial. The current study presents the protocol of our institution for preoperative and intraoperative SLN detection. Methods Fifty female patients with early breast cancer and clinically node-negative axilla were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent preoperative CT lymphography (CTLG), intraoperative SLNB using fluorescence navigation, intraoperative one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) and postoperative hematoxylin and eosin histopathological analysis. Prediction of metastasis by CTLG and detection of metastasis by OSNA were compared to results of histopathology as standard reference. Results SLN were identified by preoperative CTLG and intraoperative SLNB with fluorescence navigation in all patients, the identification rate was 100 \%. SLN metastases were detected as positive by OSNA in 9 patients (18 \%), 4 were (++), 4 were (+) and 1 was (+I). SLN metastases were detected as positive by histopathology in 10 patients (20 \%). The concordance rate between OSNA and permanent sections was 90 \%. The negative predictive value of CTLG was 80 \%. Conclusion Use of CTLG and fluorescence navigation made performing SLNB with high accuracy possible in institutions that cannot use the radioisotope method. OSNA provided accurate intraoperative method, allowing for completion of axillary node dissection during surgery and avoidance of second surgical procedure in patients with positive SLNs, thereby reducing patient distress and, finally, saving hospital costs.},

Developing countries often lack infrastructure, cytotechnologists, and pathologists necessary to implement current screening tools. Due to their low cost and ease of interpretation at the point-of-care, optical imaging technologies may serve as an appropriate solution for cervical cancer screening in low resource settings. We have developed a high-resolution optical imaging system, the High Resolution Microendoscope (HRME), which can be used to interrogate clinically suspicious areas with subcellular spatial resolution, revealing changes in nuclear to cytoplasmic area ratio. In this pilot study carried out at the women's clinic of Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana, 52 unique sites were imaged in 26 patients, and the results were compared to histopathology as a reference standard. Quantitative high resolution imaging achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 86\% and 87\%, respectively, in differentiating neoplastic (≥CIN 2) tissue from non-neoplastic tissue. These results suggest the potential promise of HRME to assist in the detection of cervical neoplasia in low-resource settings.},

Recently, in vivo DNA labelling by DNA-stains such as DRAQ5, has provided the opportunity to measure kinetic reactions of GFP-fused proteins in targeted areas of the nucleus with different chromatin compaction levels. To verify the suitability of combining DRAQ5-staining with protein dynamic measurements, we have tested the cellular consequences of DRAQ5 DNA intercalation. We show that DRAQ5 intercalation rapidly modifies both the localization and the mobility properties of several DNA-binding proteins such as histones, DNA repair, replication and transcription factors, by stimulating a release of these proteins from their substrate. Most importantly, the effect of DRAQ5 on the mobility of essential cellular enzymes results in a potent inhibition of the corresponding cellular functions. From these observations, we suggest that great caution must be used when interpreting live cell data obtained using DRAQ5.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine whether rate of reoperation after breast conserving surgery is associated with patients’ characteristics and investigate whether reoperation rates vary among English NHS trusts.
Design Cohort study using patient level data from hospital episode statistics.
Setting English NHS trusts.
Participants Adult women who had breast conserving surgery between 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2008.
Main outcome measure Reoperation rates after primary breast conserving surgery within 3 months, adjusted using logistic regression for tumour type, age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic deprivation. Tumours were grouped by whether a carcinoma in situ component was coded at the time of the primary breast conserving surgery.
Results 55 297 women had primary breast conserving surgery in 156 NHS trusts during the three year period. 11 032 (20.0\%, 95\% confidence interval 19.6\% to 20.3\%) women had at least one reoperation. 10 212 (18.5\%, 18.2\% to 18.8\%) had one reoperation only; of these, 5943 (10.7\%, 10.5\% to 11.0\%) had another breast conserving procedure and 4269 (7.7\%, 7.5\% to 7.9\%) had a mastectomy. Of the 45 793 women with isolated invasive disease, 8229 (18.0\%) had at least one reoperation. In comparison, 2803 (29.5\%) of the 9504 women with carcinoma in situ had at least one reoperation (adjusted odds ratio 1.9, 95\% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.0). Substantial differences were found in the adjusted reoperation rates among the NHS trusts (10th and 90th centiles 12.2\% and 30.2\%).
Conclusion: One in five women who had breast conserving surgery in England had a reoperation. Reoperation was nearly twice as likely when the tumour had a carcinoma in situ component coded. Women should be informed of this reoperation risk when deciding on the type of surgical treatment of their breast cancer.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The multiparameter fluorometric analysis of intact and fixed cells often requires the use of a nuclear DNA discrimination signal with spectral separation from visible range fluorochromes. We have developed a novel deep red fluorescing bisalkylaminoanthraquinone, DRAQ5 (Ex(lambdamax) 646 nm; Em(lambdamax) 681 nm; Em(lambdarange) 665-{\textgreater}800 nm), with high affinity for DNA and a high capacity to enter living cells. We describe here the spectral characteristics and applications of this synthetic compound, particularly in relation to cytometric analysis of the cell cycle.
METHODS: Cultured human tumor cells were examined for the ability to nuclear locate DRAQ5 using single and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (LSM) and multiparameter flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Multiparameter flow cytometry shows that the dye can rapidly report the cellular DNA content of live and fixed cells at a resolution level adequate for cell cycle analysis and the cycle-specific expression of cellular proteins (e.g., cyclin B1). The preferential excitation of DRAQ5 by laser red lines (633/647 nm) was found to offer a means of fluorescence signal discrimination by selective excitation, with greatly reduced emission overlap with UV-excitable and visible range fluophors as compared with propidium iodide. LSM reveals nuclear architecture and clearly defines chromosomal elements in live cells. DRAQ5 was found to permit multiphoton imaging of nuclei using a 1,047-nm emitting mode-locked YLF laser. The unusual spectral properties of DRAQ5 also permit live cell DNA analysis using conventional 488 nm excitation and the single-photon imaging of nuclear fluorescence using laser excitation between 488 nm and low infrared (IR; 780 nm) wavelengths. Single and multiphoton microscopy studies revealed the ability of DRAQ5 to report three-dimensional nuclear structure and location in live cells expressing endoplasmic reticulum targeted-GFP, MitoTracker-stained mitochondria, or a vital cell probe for free zinc (Zinquin).
CONCLUSION: The fluorescence excitation and emission characteristics of DRAQ5 in living and fixed cells permit the incorporation of the measurement of cellular DNA content into a variety of multiparameter cytometric analyses.},

	abstract = {In order to define the importance of the nucleolus in tumour pathology, the relationship between nucleolar size and function and tumour mass growth rate was studied in vivo. Ten established human cancer cell lines from colon carcinomas and neuroblastomas were inoculated subcutaneously in athymic mice and the doubling time (DT) of the xenograft tumour mass was calculated. The tumour DTs ranged from 3.2 to 15.7 days. Nucleolar size was evaluated in sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumour samples after silver staining for AgNOR proteins, using a specific image analysis system. The nucleolar area values were inversely related to the xenograft tumour mass DTs (r=−0.90; p{\textless}0.001). Nucleolar functional activity was also evaluated using rapid, intermediate, and slow growing tumours (one each). The values of RNA polymerase I activity measured in vitro were strongly related to the corresponding tumour DTs (r=−0.99; p=0.03). The labelling indices (LIs) of three proliferation markers, MIB1, PCNA, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), were also evaluated. As revealed by the MIB1 and PCNA LIs, almost all the cells of the xenograft tumours were cycling (86.6±5.6 SD and 95.5±2.0 SD, respectively). Neither the MIB1, PCNA or BrdU LIs were related to the xenograft tumour mass DT, showing that the different growth rates of tumour xenografts were not due to different growth fractions, but were mainly related to different cell proliferation rates. The present data demonstrate that the size and function of the nucleolus are related to the cell proliferation rate of cancer tissue. Evaluation of nucleolar size after silver staining of AgNOR proteins represents a unique parameter for the histological assessment of rapidity of cell proliferation in tumour lesions.

	abstract = {Genomic prediction is expected to considerably increase genetic gains by increasing selection intensity and accelerating the breeding cycle. In this study, marker effects estimated in 255 diverse maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids were used to predict grain yield, anthesis date, and anthesis-silking interval within the diversity panel and testcross progenies of 30 F2-derived lines from each of five populations. Although up to 25\% of the genetic variance could be explained by cross validation within the diversity panel, the prediction of testcross performance of F2-derived lines using marker effects estimated in the diversity panel was on average zero. Hybrids in the diversity panel could be grouped into eight breeding populations differing in mean performance. When performance was predicted separately for each breeding population on the basis of marker effects estimated in the other populations, predictive ability was low (i.e., 0.12 for grain yield). These results suggest that prediction resulted mostly from differences in mean performance of the breeding populations and less from the relationship between the training and validation sets or linkage disequilibrium with causal variants underlying the predicted traits. Potential uses for genomic prediction in maize hybrid breeding are discussed emphasizing the need of (1) a clear definition of the breeding scenario in which genomic prediction should be applied (i.e., prediction among or within populations), (2) a detailed analysis of the population structure before performing cross validation, and (3) larger training sets with strong genetic relationship to the validation set.},

The optimal management of this patient subgroup is evolving. A refined classification scheme is needed to enable the early and accurate identification of high-risk disease so that more-effective treatment paradigms can be developed. We discuss several principles established from clinical trials, and highlight other questions that remain unanswered.

	abstract = {Cytokines are known to play an important role in normal tendon development, function, and maintenance through interactions with fibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins. However, the role of interleukins on normal tendon activity remains poorly understood. Previous studies that have researched the role of specific cytokines by exogenously applying them have often reported conflicting results. Therefore, a knockout mouse model was used to investigate the role of interleukins 4 and 6 on normal tendon organizational and biomechanical properties. It was hypothesized that interleukin-6 knockout (IL6 -/-) mice will display more organized collagen orientation and greater cross-sectional area and mechanical properties when compared to that of control mice. In addition, interleukin-4 knockout (IL4 -/-) mice will display the most disorganized collagen orientation and lowest cross-sectional area and mechanical properties. As hypothesized, IL6 -/- mice show a trend towards lower angular deviation (more organized) (p\&lt;0.1) when compared to IL4 -/- mice. In addition, the IL6 -/- mice show a trend towards a higher percent relaxation (p\&lt;0.1) and a significantly higher modulus (p\&lt;0.01) when compared to CTL and IL4 -/- mice. Unexpectedly, the IL6 -/- mice exhibited no significant differences in collagen fiber distribution and maximum stress from the other groups and actually had a smaller cross-sectional area than CTL mice (p\&lt;0.1). This study supports transgenic mice as an animal model for investigating how cytokines affect normal tendon properties. In addition, this study demonstrates that interleukins may play an important role in tendon development, function, and maintenance.},

	abstract = {Quantitative histomorphometry (QH) refers to the application of advanced computational image analysis to reproducibly describe disease appearance on digitized histopathology images. QH thus could serve as an important complementary tool for pathologists in interrogating and interpreting cancer morphology and malignancy. In the US, annually, over 60,000 prostate cancer patients undergo radical prostatectomy treatment. Around 10,000 of these men experience biochemical recurrence within 5 years of surgery, a marker for local or distant disease recurrence. The ability to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence soon after surgery could allow for adjuvant therapies to be prescribed as necessary to improve long term treatment outcomes. The underlying hypothesis with our approach, co-occurring gland angularity (CGA), is that in benign or less aggressive prostate cancer, gland orientations within local neighborhoods are similar to each other but are more chaotically arranged in aggressive disease. By modeling the extent of the disorder, we can differentiate surgically removed prostate tissue sections from (a) benign and malignant regions and (b) more and less aggressive prostate cancer. For a cohort of 40 intermediate-risk (mostly Gleason sum 7) surgically cured prostate cancer patients where half suffered biochemical recurrence, the CGA features were able to predict biochemical recurrence with 73\% accuracy. Additionally, for 80 regions of interest chosen from the 40 studies, corresponding to both normal and cancerous cases, the CGA features yielded a 99\% accuracy. CGAs were shown to be statistically signicantly () better at predicting BCR compared to state-of-the-art QH methods and postoperative prostate cancer nomograms.},

	volume = {4},
	issn = {1081-4442},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of nonpalpable mammographically detected breast cancer in a cohort of conservatively treated breast cancer patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 953 patients with invasive stage I and II breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy prior to January 1990 were reviewed. Mode of presentation with reference to clinical and mammographic findings was recorded. For statistical analysis, patients were divided into two groups: 748 patients presented with clinically palpable masses with or without mammographic abnormalities (PALP), and 205 presented with nonpalpable mammographically detected tumors (MGDET).
RESULTS: Patients in the MGDET group presented with cancers at earlier stages of disease, had tumors of smaller pathological size, were more often hormone-receptor positive, and less frequently required adjuvant systemic therapy. As of December 1995, with a median follow-up of 11.6 years, the MGDET group had a higher 10-year overall survival rate (82\% vs 68\%) and a superior 10-year distant-metastasis-free rate (87\% vs 75\%). The ipsilateral breast tumor relapse rate was similar between the PALP and MGDET groups. When broken down by age ({\textless} 50 years vs {\textgreater} or = 50 years), the benefits of early detection remained apparent with a statistically significant superior distant-metastasis-free rate in women under age 50 in the MGDET group compared with women under age 50 in the PALP group. In a multivariate analysis, mammographic detection remained an independent prognostic factor for distant-metastasis-free survival.
CONCLUSION: Patients presenting with nonpalpable mammographically detected invasive breast cancer have a favorable prognosis compared with their counterparts presenting with clinically palpable masses. Although the issue of lead-time bias cannot be addressed adequately in this retrospective review, the favorable prognosis with respect to disease-free survival and breast conservation is quite evident. The high probability of disease-free survival and breast preservation in these patients should further encourage the widespread using of screening mammography and the increased use of breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy.},

	abstract = {Breast conserving surgery, in which the breast tumor and surrounding normal tissue are removed, is the primary mode of treatment for invasive and in situ carcinomas of the breast, conditions that affect nearly 200,000 women annually. Of these nearly 200,000 patients who undergo this surgical procedure, between 20–70\% of them may undergo additional surgeries to remove tumor that was left behind in the first surgery, due to the lack of intra-operative tools which can detect whether the boundaries of the excised specimens are free from residual cancer. Optical techniques have many attractive attributes which may make them useful tools for intra-operative assessment of breast tumor resection margins. In this manuscript, we discuss clinical design criteria for intra-operative breast tumor margin assessment, and review optical techniques appied to this problem. In addition, we report on the development and clinical testing of quantitative diffuse reflectance imaging (Q-DRI) as a potential solution to this clinical need. Q-DRI is a spectral imaging tool which has been applied to 56 resection margins in 48 patients at Duke University Medical Center. Clear sources of contrast between cancerous and cancer-free resection margins were identified with the device, and resulted in an overall accuracy of 75\% in detecting positive margins.},

	abstract = {Background
Frozen-section analysis (FS) of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is performed to avoid reoperation for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but it can miss micrometastatic disease, is labor intensive for the pathologist, and does not alter the number of breast-conservation therapy (BCT) patients needing reoperation for positive margins. The purpose of this study was to determine if eliminating FS would change reoperation rates in BCT patients.
Study Design
Between January 2004 and December 2005, 1,218 patients had simultaneous BCT and SLN biopsy for invasive breast cancer. FS of the SLN was used selectively at the surgeon’s discretion. Clinical and pathologic data were collected.
Results
Overall, 542 of 1,218 (44\%) patients had positive margins. FS of the SLN was performed in 931 of 1,218 (76\%) patients. In those having FS, the SLN positivity rate was 33\% (306 of 931). FS identified the positive SLN in 170 of 306 (56\%) patients with positive nodes, allowing for immediate ALND. But 101 of these 170 patients had positive lumpectomy margins; and FS of the SLN saved 69 of 931 (7\%) patients a second operation. Of patients not having FS, 48 of 287 (17\%) had a positive SLN on final pathology. Only 18 of 48 (those seen on routine hematoxylin and eosin) might have been seen on FS, potentially sparing reoperation. Half of patients not having FS required reexcision for positive margins. FS would have spared reoperation for only 8 of 287 (3\%) patients in this group. Overall, of 354 of 1,218 patients with SLN metastases, 170 had immediate ALND and 98 had delayed ALND. Of those having delayed ALND, 68 of 98 also had positive margins.
Conclusions
Among patients having BCT with SLN biopsy, FS identified the positive SLN in 56\% of patients with positive SLNs, allowing immediate ALND, and was false negative in 44\%. Margin status remains a frequent indication for reoperation in BCT; routine FS analysis of the SLN ultimately saves only a minority of patients a second operation.},

Toward this end, it has been suggested that computational models may help hasten this process by enabling time-efficient parametric studies that can reduce the experimental search space. In this paper, we present a first generation computational model for describing the in vivo development of a tissue engineered vein from an implanted polymeric scaffold. The model was motivated by our recent data on the evolution of mechanical properties and microstructural composition over 24 weeks in a mouse inferior vena cava interposition graft. It is shown that these data can be captured well by including both an early inflammatory-mediated and a subsequent mechano-mediated production of extracellular matrix. There remains a pressing need, however, for more data to inform the development of next generation models, particularly the precise transition from the inflammatory to the mechanobiological dominated production of matrix having functional capability.},

Whilst the majority of genomic profiling efforts thus far have focused on the tumor, here we investigate RNA-Seq as a hypothesis-free tool to generate independent tumor and stromal biomarkers, and explore tumor-stroma interactions by exploiting the human-murine compartment specificity of patient-derived xenografts (PDX)., Across a pan-cancer cohort of 79 PDX models, we determine that mouse stroma can be separated into distinct clusters, each corresponding to a specific stromal cell type. This implies heterogeneous recruitment of mouse stroma to the xenograft independent of tumor type. We then generate cross-species expression networks to recapitulate a known association between tumor epithelial cells and fibroblast activation, and propose a potentially novel relationship between two hypoxia-associated genes, human MIF and mouse Ddx6. Assessment of disease subtype also reveals MMP12 as a putative stromal marker of triple-negative breast cancer. Finally, we establish that our ability to dissect recruited stroma from trans-differentiated tumor cells is crucial to identifying stem-like poor-prognosis signatures in the tumor compartment., In conclusion, RNA-Seq is a powerful, cost-effective solution to global analysis of human tumor and mouse stroma simultaneously, providing new insights into mouse stromal heterogeneity and compartment-specific disease markers that are otherwise overlooked by alternative technologies. The study represents the first comprehensive analysis of its kind across multiple PDX models, and supports adoption of the approach in pre-clinical drug efficacy studies, and compartment-specific biomarker discovery.},

Patellar tendons of C57BL/6J mice were fatigue loaded at 2 Hz to three endpoints (4 N peak force per cycle for 1 h, 6 N for 1 h, and 4 N for 2 h), during which hysteresis, tangent stiffness, and peak strain of each cycle were measured. Damage accumulation was then quantified using in situ histology, and each tendon was loaded monotonically to failure. Histological damage increased significantly in all three groups (≥2-fold), and monotonic stiffness decreased significantly in the 6 N, 1 h and 4 N, 2-h groups (∼25\%), suggesting that damage initially manifests as changes to the collagen structure of the tendon and subsequently as changes to the function. For the fatigue loading protocols used in this study, none of the evaluated real-time parameters from fatigue loading correlated with damage area fraction measured structural damage or monotonic stiffness, suggesting that they are not suited to serve as proxies for damage accumulation. In future studies, this model will be used to compare the biological response of mouse tendon to fatigue damage across genetic strains. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The measurements provide an estimate of the variation of normal breast tissue optical properties in a fairly large population. The mean blood volume was 34 +/- 9 microM and the mean blood oxygen saturation was 68 +/- 8\%. We also investigated the correlation of these optical properties with demographic factors such as body mass index (BMI) and age. We observed a weak correlation of blood volume and reduced scattering coefficient with BMI: correlation with age, however, was not evident within the statistical error of these experiments.

Stress deprivation upregulated MMP-13 mRNA expression and caused progressive loss of cell-matrix contact compared to fresh controls. The application of 1\% strain to fresh tendons for 24 hours inhibited MMP-13 mRNA expression compared to stress-deprived tendons over the same period. However, when tendons were stress-deprived for 48 hours and then subjected to the same loading regime, the inhibition of MMP-13 mRNA expression was decreased. In stress-deprived tendons, it was necessary to increase the strain magnitude to 3\% to achieve the same level of MMP-13 mRNA inhibition seen in fresh tendons exercised at 1\% strain. The data suggest loss of cytoskeletal tension alters the mechanostat set point and decreases the mechanoresponsiveness of tendon cells.},

	abstract = {Summary
Screening tests are ubiquitous in contemporary practice, yet the principles of screening are widely misunderstood. Screening is the testing of apparently well people to find those at increased risk of having a disease or disorder. Although an earlier diagnosis generally has intuitive appeal, earlier might not always be better, or worth the cost. Four terms describe the validity of a screening test: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of positive and negative results. For tests with continuous variables-eg, blood glucose-sensitivity and specificity are inversely related; where the cutoff for abnormal is placed should indicate the clinical effect of wrong results. The prevalence of disease in a population affects screening test performance: in low-prevalence settings, even very good tests have poor predictive value positives. Hence, knowledge of the approximate prevalence of disease is a prerequisite to interpreting screening test results. Tests are often done in sequence, as is true for syphilis and HIV-1 infection. Lead-time and length biases distort the apparent value of screening programmes; randomised controlled trials are the only way to avoid these biases. Screening can improve health; strong indirect evidence links cervical cytology programmes to declines in cervical cancer mortality. However, inappropriate application or interpretation of screening tests can rob people of their perceived health, initiate harmful diagnostic testing, and squander health-care resources.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic decision-making for personalized management of breast cancer relies on patient stratification based on the risk conferred by clinicopathologic factors, such as stage, Ki67 Index (KI) and tumor histological grade. The most widely used histologic grading system for breast cancer, the Nottingham Grading System (NGS) provides prognostic information about breast tumor samples by combining analysis of the extent of glandular differentiation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity present in the tumor sample. In the NGS, the mitotic Index (MI) is defined as the number of mitotic cells per ten high-power fields. KI is a universal prognostic indicator but is not part of the NGS. Although the NGS has been widely used owing to its reproducibility and significant prognostic value, its accuracy in predicting disease prognosis and aggressiveness is limited. Our earlier work has demonstrated that by rationally integrating KI and MI into a new metric called the Ki67-Adjusted Mitotic Score (KAMS), which is a measure of the proportion of mitotic cells amongst Ki67-positive cells, we are able to glean a new layer of prognostic information about metastatic risk. We found that for Nottingham Grade II and III patients, high KAMS values predicted relatively better overall survival (OS) than low KAMS values.
We therefore asked if the incorporation of a KAMS-based classifier subsequent to conventional Nottingham classification, would improve patient stratification to enable their funneling towards more optimal treatment choices. Ideal KAMS thresholds were established by analyzing the KAMS-stratified survival groups and selecting the thresholds which created the widest survival stratification that was additionally confirmed to be statistically significant via a Log-Rank test. For Nottingham Grade II and III patients, an above-threshold KAMS value was deemed as low-risk and a below-threshold KAMS value was deemed as high-risk for the purpose of grade adjustment. Grade adjustments were based solely on the patients’ KAMS values. Thus the adjusted Nottingham Grade I consisted of the original Nottingham Grade I patients along with KAMS determined low-risk original Nottingham Grade II patients. Adjusted Nottingham Grade II patients were composed of KAMS determined high-risk patients originally in Nottingham Grade II along with KAMS determined low-risk original Nottingham Grade III patients. Finally, the adjusted Nottingham Grade III was made up exclusively of high-risk patients from the original Nottingham Grade III.
We found that the adjusted system represents a wider separation between OS curves with adjusted Grade I (n = 774) OS being 95.48\%, adjusted grade II (n = 727) OS at 87.62\%, and adjusted Grade III (n = 110) having an OS of 78.18\%. Overall survival groups between adjusted grade I and II and I and III (p {\textless} 0.001) showed statistical significance. We also found that the hazard ratios for all Nottingham grades are significantly better after adjustment (2.875 versus 2.034 for Grade II and 5.115 versus 3.456 for Grade III) indicating that the KAMS can function as an effective risk-stratification biomarker and that incorporation of a KAMS-based classifier enhances patient stratification.

	abstract = {Damage accumulation underlies tendinopathy. Animal models of overuse injuries do not typically control loads applied to the tendon. Our in vivo model in the rat patellar tendon allows direct control of the loading applied to the tendon. Despite this advantage, natural variation among tendons results in different amounts of damage induced by the same loading protocol. Our objectives were to (1) assess changes in the initial mechanical parameters (hysteresis, stiffness of the loading and unloading load-displacement curves, and elongation) after fatigue loading to identify parameters that are indicative of the induced damage, and (2) evaluate the relationships between these identified initial damage indices with the stiffness 7 day after loading. Left patellar tendons of adult, female retired breeder, Sprague-Dawley rats (n=68) were fatigue loaded per our previously published in vivo fatigue loading protocol. To induce a range of damage, fatigue loading consisted of either 5, 100, 500 or 7200 cycles that ranged from 1 N to 40 N. Diagnostic tests were applied before and immediately after fatigue loading, and after 45 min of recovery to deduce recoverable and non-recoverable changes in initial damage indices. Relationships between these initial damage indices and the 7-day stiffness (at sacrifice) were determined. Day-0 hysteresis, loading and unloading stiffness exhibited cycle-dependent changes. Initial hysteresis loss correlated with the 7-day stiffness. k-means cluster analysis demonstrated a relationship between 7-day stiffness and day-0 hysteresis and unloading stiffness. This analysis also separated samples that exhibited low from high damage in response to both high or low number of cycles; a key delineation for interpretation of the biological response in future studies. Identifying initial parameters that reflect the induced damage is critical since the ability of the tendon to repair depends on the damage induced and the number of applied loading cycles.},

The image sets used in this paper consisted of 367 and 268 color images for the diagnosis and Gleason grading problems, respectively, and were captured from representative areas of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue retrieved from tissue microarray cores or whole sections. The primary contribution of this paper is to aggregate color, texture, and morphometric cues at the global and histological object levels for classification. Features representing different visual cues were combined in a supervised learning framework. We compared the performance of Gaussian, -nearest neighbor, and support vector machine classifiers together with the sequential forward feature selection algorithm. On diagnosis, using a five-fold cross-validation estimate, an accuracy of 96.7\% was obtained.

	abstract = {Background
The majority of flow cytometric DNA content analyses are performed on whole peripheral blood, bone marrow or tumor samples containing significant numbers of non-malignant cells which hamper specific DNA content analysis. Simultaneous analysis of DNA content and immunophenotype greatly improves the specificity of DNA-ploidy measurements. Therefore, a three-color flow cytometric assay using DRAQ5 was developed and validated.
Methods
The results of DNA content analysis using DRAQ5 and propidium iodide were compared using peripheral blood samples of 15 healthy volunteers. The reproducibility of the multiparameter DRAQ5 assay was assayed in 10 analytical runs and the sensitivity was evaluated with addition experiments.
Result
Using DRAQ5, slightly wider CVs of the G0/G1 peak were obtained (average CV = 3.29\%). When DRAQ5 staining and immunophenotyping were combined, the within- and between-run imprecision was 1.98\% and 1.67\%, respectively and the DNA content of 25 DNA-hyperdiploid tumor cells (DNA-index = 1.16) per 4.104 mononuclear cells (0.06\%) could be determined.
Conclusions
The multiparameter DRAQ5 assay has a superior sensitivity and specificity compared to the propidium iodide based method. Since at least 25 DNA-hyperdiploid cells per 104 DNA-diploid mononuclear cells could be detected, multiparameter DRAQ5 DNA content analysis could be used to study minimal residual disease.},

	abstract = {We have have studied the relationship between nucleolar function and size and cell doubling time in cancer cells. Seven human cancer cell lines characterized by different proliferation rates were used. Nucleolar functional activity was evaluated by measuring RNA polymerase I activity and expression of RNA polymerase I upstream binding factor (UBF), DNA topoisomerase I, and fibrillarin, three proteins involved in synthesis and processing of rRNA. Transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase I was strictly related to cell doubling time (r = -0.97; P {\textless} 0.001). The quantitative distribution of UBF, DNA topoisomerase I, and fibrillarin was evaluated on Western blots using specific monoclonal antibodies by densitometric analysis of autoradiographic signals. It was found to be directly related to RNA polymerase I transcriptional activity (r = 0.89, P = 0.008 for UBF; r = 0.95, P = 0.001 for DNA topoisomerase I; and r = 0.91, P = 0.004 for fibrillarin) and inversely related to cell doubling time (r = -0.87, P = 0.011 for UBF; r = -0.97, P {\textless} 0.001 for DNA topoisomerase I; and r = -0.91, P = 0.005 for fibrillarin). The nucleolar areas were measured by automated image analysis on toluidine blue-stained cells. The values of the stained nucleolar structures per cell were directly related to RNA polymerase I transcriptional activity (r = 0.94, P = 0.001) and inversely related to cell doubling time (r = -0.98, P {\textless} 0.001). The same area values of the nucleolar structures stained by toluidine blue were also closely related to the amount of UBF (r = 0.92, P = 0.003), DNA topoisomerase I (r = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.001), and fibrillarin (r = 0.95, P = 0.001), and to the in situ quantitative distribution of AgNOR proteins (r = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.001). Our results demonstrated that in cancer cells rRNA transcriptional activity and nucleolar size are inversely related to cell doubling time. Quantitative distribution of nucleolar structures within the cell represents a cytohistological parameter of the rapidity of cell proliferation.},

Since tissue assessment heavily relies on the pathologists level of expertise and interpretation criteria, it is still a subjective process with high intra- and interobserver variability. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) may have a major impact on detection and grading of PCa by reducing the pathologists reading time, and increasing the accuracy and reproducibility of diagnosis outcomes. However, the complexity of the prostatic tissue and the large volumes of data generated by biopsy procedures make the development of CAD systems for PCa a challenging task. The problem of automated diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma from histopathology has received a lot of attention. As a result, a number of CAD systems, have been proposed for quantitative image analysis and classification. This article aims at providing a detailed description of selected literature in the field of CAD of PCa, emphasizing the role of texture analysis methods in tissue description. It includes a review of image analysis tools for image preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and validation techniques used in PCa detection and grading, as well as future directions in pursuit of better texture-based CAD systems.},

Whereas regression of lesions was shown for premalignant lesions caused by HPV, clinical benefit in cancer patients was mostly noted as prolonged survival. Suboptimal vaccine design and an immunosuppressive cancer microenvironment are the root causes of the lack of cancer eradication. Effective cancer vaccines deliver concentrated antigen to both HLA class I and II molecules of DCs, promoting both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. Optimal vaccine platforms include DNA and RNA vaccines and synthetic long peptides. Antigens of choice include mutant sequences, selected cancer testis antigens, and viral antigens. Drugs or physical treatments can mitigate the immunosuppressive cancer microenvironment and include chemotherapeutics, radiation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors, inhibitors of T cell checkpoints, agonists of selected TNF receptor family members, and inhibitors of undesirable cytokines. The specificity of therapeutic vaccination combined with such immunomodulation offers an attractive avenue for the development of future cancer therapies.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a strategy to “sense” the micro-morphology of a breast tumor margin over a wide field of view by creating quantitative hyperspectral maps of the tissue optical properties (absorption and scattering), where each voxel can be deconstructed to provide information on the underlying histology. Information about the underlying tissue histology is encoded in the quantitative spectral information (in the visible wavelength range), and residual carcinoma is detected as a shift in the histological landscape to one with less fat and higher glandular content. To demonstrate this strategy, fully intact, fresh lumpectomy specimens (n = 88) from 70 patients were imaged intra-operatively. The ability of spectral imaging to sense changes in histology over large imaging areas was determined using inter-patient mammographic breast density (MBD) variation in cancer-free tissues as a model system. We discovered that increased MBD was associated with higher baseline β-carotene concentrations (p = 0.066) and higher scattering coefficients (p = 0.007) as measured by spectral imaging, and a trend toward decreased adipocyte size and increased adipocyte density as measured by histological examination in BMI-matched patients. The ability of spectral imaging to detect cancer intra-operatively was demonstrated when MBD-specific breast characteristics were considered. Specifically, the ratio of β-carotene concentration to the light scattering coefficient can report on the relative amount of fat to glandular density at the tissue surface to determine positive margin status, when baseline differences in these parameters between patients with low and high MBD are taken into account by the appropriate selection of threshold values. When MBD was included as a variable a priori, the device was estimated to have a sensitivity of 74\% and a specificity of 86\% in detecting close or positive margins, regardless of tumor type. Superior performance was demonstrated in high MBD tissue, a population that typically has a higher percentage of involved margins.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To develop a robust tool for quantitative in situ pathology that allows visualization of heterogeneous tissue morphology and segmentation and quantification of image features.

Materials and Methods
Tissue excised from a genetically engineered mouse model of sarcoma was imaged using a subcellular resolution microendoscope after topical application of a fluorescent anatomical contrast agent: acriflavine. An algorithm based on sparse component analysis (SCA) and the circle transform (CT) was developed for image segmentation and quantification of distinct tissue types. The accuracy of our approach was quantified through simulations of tumor and muscle images. Specifically, tumor, muscle, and tumor+muscle tissue images were simulated because these tissue types were most commonly observed in sarcoma margins. Simulations were based on tissue characteristics observed in pathology slides. The potential clinical utility of our approach was evaluated by imaging excised margins and the tumor bed in a cohort of mice after surgical resection of sarcoma.

Results
Simulation experiments revealed that SCA+CT achieved the lowest errors for larger nuclear sizes and for higher contrast ratios (nuclei intensity/background intensity). For imaging of tumor margins, SCA+CT effectively isolated nuclei from tumor, muscle, adipose, and tumor+muscle tissue types. Differences in density were correctly identified with SCA+CT in a cohort of ex vivo and in vivo images, thus illustrating the diagnostic potential of our approach.

Conclusion
The combination of a subcellular-resolution microendoscope, acriflavine staining, and SCA+CT can be used to accurately isolate nuclei and quantify their density in anatomical images of heterogeneous tissue.},

	abstract = {High-risk breast lesions, which comprise benign lesions and in situ carcinomas (lobular carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ), are clinically, morphologically, and biologically heterogeneous and are associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer development, albeit to varying degrees. Recognition and proactive management of such lesions can help to prevent progression to invasive disease, and might, therefore, reduce breast cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. However, this opportunity comes with the possibility of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, necessitating risk-based intervention. Notably, despite the progress in defining the molecular changes associated with carcinogenesis, alterations identifying the individuals with high-risk lesions that will progress to invasive carcinoma remain to be identified. Thus, until reproducible clinicopathological or molecular features predicting an individual's risk of breast cancer are found, management strategies must be defined by population-level risks as determined by models such as the Gail or IBIS models, as well as patient attitudes toward the risks and benefits of interventions. Herein, we review the contemporary approaches to diagnosis and management of high-risk breast lesions. Progress in this area will ultimately be dependent on the ability to individualize risk prediction through better definition of the key drivers in the carcinogenic process.},

	abstract = {Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) plays a key role in restraining the adaptive immune response of T-cells towards a variety of antigens including tumor associated antigens (TAAs). The blockade of this immune checkpoint elicits an effective anticancer immune response in a range of preclinical models, suggesting that naturally occurring (or therapeutically induced) TAA specific lymphocytes need to be “unleashed” in order to properly fight against malignant cells. Therefore, investigators have tested this therapeutic hypothesis also in humans: the favorable results obtained with this strategy in patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma are revolutionizing the management of this highly aggressive disease and are fueling new enthusiasm on cancer immunotherapy in general.

Here we summarize the biology of CTLA-4, overview the experimental data supporting the rational for targeting CTLA-4 to treat cancer and review the main clinical findings on this novel anticancer approach.

The association with cancer specific survival (CSS) was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses., Results: Whereas tumour size, patient age, menopausal status, type of surgery, or adjuvant treatment were not related to prognosis, histological type (p {\textless} 0.01) and NHG (p {\textless} 0.005) were associated with CSS. When evaluating the components of NHG separately, survival was not related to the score for pleomorphism, but was significantly better in tumours with score 1 or 2 for tubule formation (p {\textless} 0.007) and in those with score 1 for mitotic counts (p {\textless} 0.006). The two components retained independent significance in multivariate analysis. When the proposed cut off points for mitotic counts were replaced by lower ones based on tertile values, the mitotic index became the strongest prognostic factor (p = 0.0001) and histological type was the only additional factor of independent prognostic significance., Conclusions: These findings confirm the prognostic value of NHG in pT1N0M0 breast carcinoma, show that the evaluation of tubule formation and mitotic rate provides independent prognostic information, and suggest that the proposed cut off points for mitotic counts may be too high for this particular group of tumours.},

The standard of care to evaluate surgical margins is based on permanent section.

An automated image screening process has been developed to detect cancerous cells from IC on cauterized margins. Methods. IC was prospectively performed on margins during lumpectomy operations for breast cancer in addition to permanent section on 127 patients. An 8-slide training subset and 8-slide testing subset were culled. H\&E IC automated analysis, based on linear discriminant analysis, was compared to manual pathologist interpretation. Results. The most important descriptors, from highest to lowest performance, are nucleus color (23\%), cytoplasm color (15\%), shape (12\%), grey intensity (9\%), and local area (5\%). There was 100\% agreement between automated and manual interpretation of IC slides. Conclusion. Although limited by IC sampling variability, an automated system for accurate IC cancer cell identification system is demonstrated, with high correlation to manual analysis, even in the face of cauterization effects which supplement permanent section analysis.},

A total of 688 patients underwent a stereotactic large-core (14G) needle biopsy and subsequent surgical excision of 718 non-palpable breast lesions. Forty-two pathologists from 10 departments of pathology (generalists) made a diagnosis on both the needle and open biopsy specimens. Afterwards, three pathologists and two radiologists with extensive experience in breast pathology (experts) diagnosed all of the biopsy specimens. The general pathologists made a similar histological diagnosis as the experts in 632 (88\%) of the needle biopsies and 649 (90\%) of the open biopsy specimens. Accordingly, the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of large-core needle biopsies between the general and experts pathologists was excellent (kappa 0.83) and not significantly different from the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of open breast biopsies (kappa 0.86). However, many inconsistencies were observed in the category of borderline lesions: only 24\% of the large-core needle biopsies and 43\% of the open biopsies with an expert diagnosis of ‘borderline’ were diagnosed similarly by the general pathologists. Additionally, the risk of benign/malignant inconsistencies between general pathologists and experts was approximately 1 in 55 for both needle and open biopsies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To learn if people with persistent developmental stuttering and atypical anatomy of their auditory temporal cortex have, when compared to control subjects, changes in fluency induced with delayed auditory feedback (DAF).
BACKGROUND: DAF improves fluency in many individuals who stutter, and induces dysfluency in some normal people. The planum temporale (PT), a portion of auditory temporal cortex, is anatomically atypical in some adults who stutter and atypical anatomy might induce aberrant function. Thus, the people who demonstrate the paradoxical response to DAF might be those who have atypical anatomy.
METHODS: Experimental subjects were adults with developmental stuttering (n = 14) and control subjects (n = 14) matched for age, sex, education, and handedness. Volumetric MRI scans of all subjects were obtained and the PT was measured in the right and left hemispheres. Based on these scans, subjects were classified as typical (leftward PT asymmetry) or atypical (rightward PT asymmetry). Prose passages were read at baseline, with non-altered feedback (NAF), and with DAF, and fluency was measured in these three conditions.
RESULTS: At baseline the adults with developmental stuttering were significantly more dysfluent than controls (p {\textless} 0.0005). Controls' fluency did not significantly change with DAF, but DAF improved fluency in adults with developmental stuttering (p {\textless} 0.0005). In the stutter group enhanced fluency was associated with atypical (rightward) PT asymmetry, and the presence of typical (leftward) PT asymmetry was not associated with any significant change in fluency. The individuals with atypical PT asymmetry also had more severe stuttering at baseline compared to the experimental subjects with typical PT anatomy.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults with persistent developmental stuttering and atypical PT anatomy, fluency is improved with DAF. These experimental subjects who showed improvement had more severe stuttering at baseline. Anomalous PT anatomy may be a neural risk for developmental stuttering in some individuals. Although a number of explanations are tenable, it may be that atypical rightward PT asymmetry may alter speech feedback, and treatment with DAF might allow these people to compensate.},

A retrospective analysis on 1407 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and 243 invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) was performed in order to compare the histological features, the immunohistochemical characteristics, the surgical treatment and the clinical outcome in the two groups.
Results
ILC seems to be more likely multifocal, estrogen receptor positive, HER-2 negative and to have a lower proliferative index compared to IDC. ILC, when treated with conservative surgery, required more frequently re-excision and/or mastectomy because of positive resection margins. No difference was observed in terms of 5-year disease free survival and local relapse free survival between the two groups, in the whole series and in the subgroup of patients treated with breast-conserving treatment.
Conclusion
ILC can be safely treated with conservative surgery but a more accurate preoperative evaluation of tumor size and multifocality could be advocated, in order to reduce the re-excision rate.},

	abstract = {Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) allows imaging of fluorescently labelled biological samples with a spatial resolution improved by a factor of approximately two compared to traditional optical microscopy techniques. The cost of this resolution improvement is the need to capture a number of raw images of the sample to reconstruct a single SIM image, increasing sample light exposure and limiting the ability of the technique to capture dynamic processes. In this paper we describe image acquisition and reconstruction techniques that allow fast super-resolution imaging within optically thick specimens. By exploiting overlaps between SIM information passbands we are able to generate optically sectioned, super-resolution images from an image sequence acquired in a single focal plane. We consider how single plane super-resolution images may be obtained using 2D and 3D SIM illumination patterns, and compare the resulting images to those obtained using conventional 2D SIM reconstruction methods. By combining a single plane reconstruction algorithm with hardware for high-speed switching between illumination patterns and rapid acquisition of fluorescence images, we demonstrate high speed super-resolution imaging inside biological organisms.},

	abstract = {Background Negative margins are associated with reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS). However, there is no consensus about the best minimum margin width.
Methods We searched the PubMed database for studies of DCIS published in English between January 1970 and July 2010 and examined the relationship between IBTR and margin status after BCS for DCIS. Women with DCIS were stratified into two groups, BCS with or without radiotherapy. We used frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of IBTR for groups with negative margins and positive margins. We further examined specific margin thresholds using mixed treatment comparisons and meta-regression techniques. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results We identified 21 studies published in 24 articles. A total of 1066 IBTR events occurred in 7564 patients, including BCS alone (565 IBTR events in 3098 patients) and BCS with radiotherapy (501 IBTR events in 4466 patients). Compared with positive margins, negative margins were associated with reduced risk of IBTR in patients with radiotherapy (OR = 0.46, 95\% credible interval [CrI] = 0.35 to 0.59), and in patients without radiotherapy (OR = 0.34, 95\% CrI = 0.24 to 0.47). Compared with patients with positive margins, the risk of IBTR for patients with negative margins was smaller (negative margin {\textgreater}0 mm, OR = 0.45, 95\% CrI = 0.38 to 0.53; {\textgreater}2 mm, OR = 0.38, 95\% CrI = 0.28 to 0.51; {\textgreater}5 mm, OR = 0.55, 95\% CrI = 0.15 to 1.30; and {\textgreater}10 mm, OR = 0.17, 95\% CrI = 0.12 to 0.24). Compared with a negative margin greater than 2 mm, a negative margin of at least 10 mm was associated with a lower risk of IBTR (OR = 0.46, 95\% CrI = 0.29 to 0.69). We found a probability of .96 that a negative margin threshold greater than 10 mm is the best option compared with other margin thresholds.
Conclusions Negative surgical margins should be obtained for DCIS patients after BCS regardless of radiotherapy. Within cosmetic constraint, surgeons should attempt to achieve negative margins as wide as possible in their first attempt. More studies are needed to understand whether margin thresholds greater than 10 mm are warranted.},

	abstract = {Cancer is associated with specific cellular morphological changes, such as increased nuclear size and crowding from rapidly proliferating cells. In situ tissue imaging using fluorescent stains may be useful for intraoperative detection of residual cancer in surgical tumor margins. We developed a widefield fluorescence structured illumination microscope (SIM) system with a single-shot FOV of 2.1×1.6 mm (3.4 mm2) and sub-cellular resolution (4.4 µm). The objectives of this work were to measure the relationship between illumination pattern frequency and optical sectioning strength and signal-to-noise ratio in turbid (i.e. thick) samples for selection of the optimum frequency, and to determine feasibility for detecting residual cancer on tumor resection margins, using a genetically engineered primary mouse model of sarcoma. The SIM system was tested in tissue mimicking solid phantoms with various scattering levels to determine impact of both turbidity and illumination frequency on two SIM metrics, optical section thickness and modulation depth. To demonstrate preclinical feasibility, ex vivo 50 µm frozen sections and fresh intact thick tissue samples excised from a primary mouse model of sarcoma were stained with acridine orange, which stains cell nuclei, skeletal muscle, and collagenous stroma. The cell nuclei were segmented using a high-pass filter algorithm, which allowed quantification of nuclear density. The results showed that the optimal illumination frequency was 31.7 µm−1 used in conjunction with a 4×0.1 NA objective ( = 0.165). This yielded an optical section thickness of 128 µm and an 8.9×contrast enhancement over uniform illumination. We successfully demonstrated the ability to resolve cell nuclei in situ achieved via SIM, which allowed segmentation of nuclei from heterogeneous tissues in the presence of considerable background fluorescence. Specifically, we demonstrate that optical sectioning of fresh intact thick tissues performed equivalently in regards to nuclear density quantification, to physical frozen sectioning and standard microscopy.},

The locations of the cell nuclei in the image are detected with circular Hough transform (CHT) and local maximum filtering. The elimination of false positive findings (noisy circles and blood cells) is achieved using Otsu’s thresholding method and fuzzy C-means clustering technique. The segmentation of the nuclei boundaries is accomplished with the application of the marker controlled watershed transform in the gradient image, using the nuclei markers extracted in the detection step. The proposed method is evaluated using 92 breast cytological images containing 11,502 cell nuclei. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed method has very effective results even in the case of images with high degree of blood cells, noisy circles.},

These methods are based on retrospective analyses of empirical data consisting of genotypic and phenotypic scores. Recent reports have indicated that parametric methods are unable to predict phenotypes of traits with known epistatic genetic architectures. Herein, we review parametric methods including least squares regression, ridge regression, Bayesian ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian LASSO, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayes Cπ. We also review nonparametric methods including Nadaraya-Watson estimator, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, support vector machine regression, and neural networks. We assess the relative merits of these 14 methods in terms of accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) using simulated genetic architectures consisting of completely additive or two-way epistatic interactions in an F2 population derived from crosses of inbred lines. Each simulated genetic architecture explained either 30\% or 70\% of the phenotypic variability. The greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE was due to genetic architecture. Parametric methods were unable to predict phenotypic values when the underlying genetic architecture was based entirely on epistasis. Parametric methods were slightly better than nonparametric methods for additive genetic architectures. Distinctions among parametric methods for additive genetic architectures were incremental. Heritability, i.e., proportion of phenotypic variability, had the second greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE.},

	abstract = {Muscle fiber images play an important role in the medical diagnosis and treatment of many muscular diseases. The number of nuclei in skeletal muscle fiber images is a key bio-marker of the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. In nuclei segmentation one primary challenge is to correctly separate the clustered nuclei. In this article, we developed an image processing pipeline to automatically detect, segment, and analyze nuclei in microscopic image of muscle fibers. The pipeline consists of image pre-processing, identification of isolated nuclei, identification and segmentation of clustered nuclei, and quantitative analysis. Nuclei are initially extracted from background by using local Otsu's threshold. Based on analysis of morphological features of the isolated nuclei, including their areas, compactness, and major axis lengths, a Bayesian network is trained and applied to identify isolated nuclei from clustered nuclei and artifacts in all the images. Then a two-step refined watershed algorithm is applied to segment clustered nuclei. After segmentation, the nuclei can be quantified for statistical analysis. Comparing the segmented results with those of manual analysis and an existing technique, we find that our proposed image processing pipeline achieves good performance with high accuracy and precision. The presented image processing pipeline can therefore help biologists increase their throughput and objectivity in analyzing large numbers of nuclei in muscle fiber images. Microsc. Res.

False claims include (i) behaviorism, (ii) computationalism, (iii) epiphenomenalism, (iv) the readiness potential, (v) subjectivity, and (vi) materialism. Ontological subjectivity does not preclude epistemic objectivity. Observer relative phenomena are created by consciousness, but consciousness is not itself observer relative. Consciousness consists of feeling, sentience, or awareness with (i) qualitativeness, (ii) ontological subjectivity, (iii) unified conscious field, (iv) intentionality, and (v) intentional causation. All conscious states are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain, and they are realized in the brain as higher level features. Efforts to get a detailed scientific account of how brain processes cause consciousness are disappointing. The Darwinian revolution gave us a new form of explanation; two levels were substituted: a causal level, where we specify the mechanism by which the phenotype functions, and a functional level, where we specify the selectional advantage that the phenotype provides. Sociobiology attempted to explain general features of human society, ethics, etc. It failed. For the incest taboo, it confuses inhibition with prohibition. It did not explain the moral force of the taboo. To explain the function of consciousness we cannot ask, "What would be subtracted if we subtracted consciousness but left everything else the same?" We cannot leave everything else the same because consciousness is necessary for higher functions of human and animal life. The unified conscious field gives the organism vastly increased power.},

Some studies have assessed the role of SLRPs in the mechanical response of the tendon, but the relationships between sophisticated mechanics, assembly of collagen, and SLRPs have not been well characterized. Decorin content was varied in a dose dependent manner using decorin null, decorin heterozygote, and wild type mice. Quantitative measures of mechanical (tension and compression), compositional, and structural changes of the mouse patellar tendon were evaluated. Viscoelastic, tensile dynamic modulus was increased in the decorin heterozygous tendons compared to wild type. These tendons also had a significant decrease in total collagen and no structural changes compared to wild type. Decorin null tendons did not have any mechanical changes; however, a significant decrease in the average fibril diameter was found. No differences were seen between genotypes in elastic or compressive properties, and all tendons demonstrated viscoelastic mechanical dependence on strain rate and frequency. These results suggest that decorin, a member of the SLRP family, plays a role in tendon viscoelasticity that cannot be completely explained by its role in collagen fibrillogenesis. In addition, reductions in decorin do not cause large changes in indentation compressive properties, suggesting that other factors contribute to these properties. Understanding these relationships may ultimately help guide development of tissue engineered constructs or treatment modalities.},

The Gleason grading method was devised in the 1960s and 1970s by Dr Donald F Gleason and members of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group. This grading system is based entirely on the histologic pattern of arrangement of carcinoma cells in H\&E-stained sections. Five basic grade patterns are used to generate a histologic score, which can range from 2 to 10. These patterns are illustrated in a standard drawing that can be employed as a guide for recognition of the specific Gleason grades. Increasing Gleason grade is directly related to a number of histopathologic end points, including tumor size, margin status, and pathologic stage. Indeed, models have been developed that allow for pretreatment prediction of pathologic stage based upon needle biopsy Gleason grade, total serum prostate-specific antigen level, and clinical stage. Gleason grade has been linked to a number of clinical end points, including clinical stage, progression to metastatic disease, and survival. Gleason grade is often incorporated into nomograms used to predict response to a specific therapy, such as radiotherapy or surgery. Needle biopsy Gleason grade is routinely used to plan patient management and is also often one of the criteria for eligibility for clinical trials testing new therapies. Gleason grade should be routinely reported for adenocarcinoma of the prostate in all types of tissue samples. Experimental approaches that could be of importance in the future include determination of percentage of high-grade Gleason pattern 4 or 5, and utilization of markers discovered by gene expression profiling or by genetic testing for DNA abnormalities. Such markers would be of prognostic usefulness if they provided added value beyond the established indicators of Gleason grade, serum prostate-specific antigen, and stage. Currently, established prognostic factors for prostatic carcinoma recommended for routine reporting are TNM stage, surgical margin status, serum prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason grade.},

	abstract = {. Subtle morphological changes and molecular alterations have been reported in normal-appearing tissue in prostates with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer (PCa). The severity and the distribution of these changes and alterations within the prostate gland have not been addressed in previous publications. The aim of this study was to investigate morphometrically the nuclear changes of the normal-looking columnar epithelium adjacent to and distant from high-grade PIN and PCa. Karyometry was performed on the whole-mount histological sections of three radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. Two concentrical lines, one corresponding to the outer surface (or capsule) of the prostate and the other corresponding to one centimeter towards the center, were drawn with a black pen on each whole-mount section. The part of the prostate tissue between these two boundaries was then divided into twelve equal sectors or regions. The part within the inner line was divided into two regions. The analysis was also performed on the slides of the apex and base of the prostate. One prostate contained normal-looking epithelium only (case no. 1). Another contained both high-grade PIN and PCa, the former occupying larger areas than the latter (case no. 2). Both high-grade PIN and PCa were present in the third sample, in which PCa was more widely distributed than PIN (case no. 3). The lesion measured in each region was always the most severe, e.g., either high-grade PIN or PCa. When neither were identifiable, then the normal-looking columnar epithelium was analyzed. For each sector, the mean and standard deviation of the nuclear area, maximum nuclear diameter, nuclear roundness factor, and nucleolar area were calculated. In normal-looking columnar epithelium, the mean of the mean nuclear area of the sectors of case no. 1 was 35.19 µm2 (SD 4.14). The mean nuclear areas in cases no. 2 and no. 3 were 37.94 µm2 (SD 4.65) and 37.31 µm2 (SD 4.36), respectively. The mean of the mean nuclear area of the sectors with high-grade PIN of case no. 2 was 49.85 µm2 (SD 8.44), whereas it was 54.26 µm2 (SD 2.91) in case no. 3. The mean of the nuclear area values obtained in the sectors of cases no. 2 and no. 3 with PCa was 56.74 µm2 (SD 6.56) and 61.17 µm2 (SD 8.13), respectively. When considering the normal-looking tissue of the second and third case, 79\% and 90\%, respectively, of the regions showed nuclear area values greater than 34.94 µm2 (e.g., the 50th percentile of the mean nuclear area values of the regions of the first case). Sectors with normal-looking epithelium, whose nuclear area was above this threshold, were both adjacent to and at a distance of more than 1 cm from those with PIN or PCa. The other nuclear features showed a similar trend of value changes. This study demonstrates that the normal-looking ducts and acini from prostate harboring preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions show morphological nuclear abnormalities that are not seen by the human eyes but that can be detected with image analysis. Such changes may be of diagnostic importance, especially in cases where clinical suspicion for cancer prevails after a negative biopsy.},

	abstract = {Background
The effect of increasing negative margin width following breast conserving therapy (BCT) on local recurrence (LR) is controversial. LR rates vary by subtype, with the highest rates seen in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study examined LR rates in relationship to margin width in TNBC treated with BCT.

Methods
Women with TNBC who underwent BCT between 1999-2009 were identified. Margins were defined as positive (ink on tumor), 0.1-2.0, and 2 mm. Patients with positive margins were excluded. Statistical comparisons were by t tests, Fishers exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Cumulative incidence of LR was compared using competing-risks methodology.

Results
Of 535 cancers, 71 had margins ≤2mm and 464 had margins {\textgreater}2mm. At median follow-up of 84 months (range 8-165 months) there were 37 local, 18 regional, and 77 distant recurrences or deaths as first events. 10 patients had a locoregional recurrence prior to planned radiation therapy and were excluded from cumulative incidence analyses. The cumulative incidence of LR at 60 months for margins ≤2mm was 4.7\% (95\% CI 0, 10.0), and for {\textgreater}2mm 3.7\% (1.8, 5.5), p=0.11. After controlling for chemotherapy and tumor size, there was no difference in LR between the two margin groups (p=.06). A difference in the risk of distant recurrence or death was not observed (p=.53).

Conclusions
Margin width greater than 2mm was not associated with reduced LR rates. This data supports a negative margin definition of no ink on tumor, even in this high risk TNBC cohort.},

	abstract = {Summary
Much progress has been made in research for prostate cancer in the past decade. There is now greater understanding for the genetic basis of familial prostate cancer with identification of rare but high-risk mutations (eg, BRCA2, HOXB13) and low-risk but common alleles (77 identified so far by genome-wide association studies) that could lead to targeted screening of patients at risk. This is especially important because screening for prostate cancer based on prostate-specific antigen remains controversial due to the high rate of overdiagnosis and unnecessary prostate biopsies, despite evidence that it reduces mortality. Classification of prostate cancer into distinct molecular subtypes, including mutually exclusive ETS-gene-fusion-positive and SPINK1-overexpressing, CHD1-loss cancers, could allow stratification of patients for different management strategies. Presently, men with localised disease can have very different prognoses and treatment options, ranging from observation alone through to radical surgery, with few good-quality randomised trials to inform on the best approach for an individual patient. The survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer progressing on androgen-deprivation therapy (castration-resistant prostate cancer) has improved substantially. In addition to docetaxel, which has been used for more than a decade, in the past 4 years five new drugs have shown efficacy with improvements in overall survival leading to licensing for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Because of this rapid change in the therapeutic landscape, no robust data exist to inform on the selection of patients for a specific treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer or the best sequence of administration. Moreover, the high cost of the newer drugs limits their widespread use in several countries. Data from continuing clinical and translational research are urgently needed to improve, and, crucially, to personalise management.},

	abstract = {Total mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation have been shown to have equivalent patient outcomes, which has likely contributed to the more widespread adoption of breast conserving surgery (BCS) procedures. Assessment of breast lumpectomy margin widths in both an accurate and timely manner is essential to successful breast conservation procedures. Current BCS methodologies have been reported to result in reoperation rates of up to 20–60\%, which represents a significant and unmet need for improved margin assessment. High reoperation rates present both increased treatment risk to patients and increased burden on healthcare systems. In the USA alone, over 150,000 lumpectomies are performed per year at an average cost between \$11,000 and \$19,000 USD per procedure. Assuming a relatively modest average repeat operation rate of 25\%, potentially preventable repeat surgeries represent an approximate cost to the US healthcare system of \$500M (USD) annually.
Reducing the prevalence of repeat surgeries may be accomplished by providing faster and more accurate intraoperative tools for assessing margin widths during the time of the first surgery. One such potential technique involves the use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging, which uses light to produce images in much the same way that ultrasound produces images with sound. Compared to ultrasound, OCT provides decreased depth of penetration, but increased resolution capabilities. The increased resolution that OCT provides allows for the visualization of the internal cellular structure within a tissue sample and therefore, provides the potential ability to differentiate cancerous from normal or benign cells. We propose the use of an intraoperative OCT imaging system to provide near real-time imaging information about the internal structure of tissue samples excised during BCS procedures. Our hypothesis is that the overall rate of repeat operations can be reduced by providing a tool to assist surgeons with the task of margin width estimation during the time of surgery.
We have developed an early stage prototype OCT imaging system that has completed laboratory phantom and preclinical studies. This paper will present the capabilities of an OCT imaging system to provide margin assessment information in biological breast tissue mimicking phantoms. The phantoms were designed to encompass imaging characteristics across a wide range of human breast densities. The paper will go on to describe preclinical imaging that was done in tumor specimens excised from human breast cancer rat models. The results obtained in the phantom and preclinical studies suggest the potential for OCT as a near-real time, intraoperative imaging tool to aid surgeons with breast lumpectomy margin width estimation. To help realize this potential, further research is required in to the use of OCT during BCS.

Core needle biopsy (CNB) is used increasingly not only to diagnose breast cancer, but to determine tumor histology, grade and marker expression, select neoadjuvant therapy, and predict sentinel lymph node status. Thus, we undertook this study to evaluate the accuracy of CNB as a predictor of breast cancer histology and marker expression.
Methods
We identified 209 Breast Cancer Registry cases with a preoperative CNB and reviewed all clinicopathologic data for accuracy. Statistical analysis was performed with statistical software.
Results
CNB unequivocally showed cancer in 93\%. Exact tumor histology concordance was 86\%. Ductal carcinoma in situ on CNB was upgraded to invasive cancer in 23\%. Concordance was substantial for estrogen receptor expression (88\%, κ = .71), but kappa values were less than .6 for tumor grade, mitotic rate, progesterone receptor (PR), Ki-67, HER-2/neu, and p53 expression.
Conclusions
Reliance on CNB grade and marker expression for critical decision making may be inadvisable. Further study is warranted to optimize breast cancer patient care.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Segmentation of breast lesions on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the first step in lesion diagnosis in a computer-aided diagnosis framework. Because manual segmentation of such lesions is both time consuming and highly susceptible to human error and issues of reproducibility, an automated lesion segmentation method is highly desirable. Traditional automated image segmentation methods such as boundary-based active contour (AC) models require a strong gradient at the lesion boundary. Even when region-based terms are introduced to an AC model, grayscale image intensities often do not allow for clear definition of foreground and background region statistics. Thus, there is a need to find alternative image representations that might provide (1) strong gradients at the margin of the object of interest (OOI); and (2) larger separation between intensity distributions and region statistics for the foreground and background, which are necessary to halt evolution of the AC model upon reaching the border of the OOI., Methods: In this paper, the authors introduce a spectral embedding (SE) based AC (SEAC) for lesion segmentation on breast DCE-MRI. SE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme, is applied to the DCE time series in a voxelwise fashion to reduce several time point images to a single parametric image where every voxel is characterized by the three dominant eigenvectors. This parametric eigenvector image (PrEIm) representation allows for better capture of image region statistics and stronger gradients for use with a hybrid AC model, which is driven by both boundary and region information. They compare SEAC to ACs that employ fuzzy c-means (FCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) as alternative image representations. Segmentation performance was evaluated by boundary and region metrics as well as comparing lesion classification using morphological features from SEAC, PCA+AC, and FCM+AC., Results: On a cohort of 50 breast DCE-MRI studies, PrEIm yielded overall better region and boundary-based statistics compared to the original DCE-MR image, FCM, and PCA based image representations. Additionally, SEAC outperformed a hybrid AC applied to both PCA and FCM image representations. Mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for SEAC was significantly better (DSC = 0.74 ± 0.21) than FCM+AC (DSC = 0.50 ± 0.32) and similar to PCA+AC (DSC = 0.73 ± 0.22). Boundary-based metrics of mean absolute difference and Hausdorff distance followed the same trends. Of the automated segmentation methods, breast lesion classification based on morphologic features derived from SEAC segmentation using a support vector machine classifier also performed better (AUC = 0.67 ± 0.05; p {\textless} 0.05) than FCM+AC (AUC = 0.50 ± 0.07), and PCA+AC (AUC = 0.49 ± 0.07)., Conclusions: In this work, we presented SEAC, an accurate, general purpose AC segmentation tool that could be applied to any imaging domain that employs time series data. SE allows for projection of time series data into a PrEIm representation so that every voxel is characterized by the dominant eigenvectors, capturing the global and local time-intensity curve similarities in the data. This PrEIm allows for the calculation of strong tensor gradients and better region statistics than the original image intensities or alternative image representations such as PCA and FCM. The PrEIm also allows for building a more accurate hybrid AC scheme.},

Gleason score is the most common method of grading the virulence of prostate malignancy and is based on the pathological assessment of morphology of cellular matrix.

In this preliminary in vitro study reported here, we have analyzed 27 tissue samples (normal control = 7: benign = 8: malignant = 12) by Stokes’ shift spectra (SSS) to establish a one-to-one correspondence between spectral grading and Gleason grading.},

	abstract = {We do not have an adequate theory of consciousness. Both dualism and materialism are mistaken because they deny consciousness is part of the physical world. False claims include (i) behaviorism, (ii) computationalism, (iii) epiphenomenalism, (iv) the readiness potential, (v) subjectivity, and (vi) materialism. Ontological subjectivity does not preclude epistemic objectivity. Observer relative phenomena are created by consciousness, but consciousness is not itself observer relative. Consciousness consists of feeling, sentience, or awareness with (i) qualitativeness, (ii) ontological subjectivity, (iii) unified conscious field, (iv) intentionality, and (v) intentional causation. All conscious states are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain, and they are realized in the brain as higher level features. Efforts to get a detailed scientific account of how brain processes cause consciousness are disappointing. The Darwinian revolution gave us a new form of explanation; two levels were substituted: a causal level, where we specify the mechanism by which the phenotype functions, and a functional level, where we specify the selectional advantage that the phenotype provides. Sociobiology attempted to explain general features of human society, ethics, etc. It failed. For the incest taboo, it confuses inhibition with prohibition. It did not explain the moral force of the taboo. To explain the function of consciousness we cannot ask, “What would be subtracted if we subtracted consciousness but left everything else the same?” We cannot leave everything else the same because consciousness is necessary for higher functions of human and animal life. The unified conscious field gives the organism vastly increased power.},

	abstract = {Chemotherapy is the primary established systemic treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in both the early and advanced-stages of the disease. The lack of targeted therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with TNBC have fostered a major effort to discover actionable molecular targets to treat patients with these tumours. Massively parallel sequencing and other 'omics' technologies have revealed an unexpected level of heterogeneity of TNBCs and have led to the identification of potentially actionable molecular features in some TNBCs, such as germline BRCA1/2 mutations or 'BRCAness', the presence of the androgen receptor, and several rare genomic alterations. Whether these alterations are molecular 'drivers', however, has not been clearly established. A subgroup of TNBCs shows a high degree of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes that also correlates with a lower risk of disease relapse and a higher likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy. Proof-of-principle studies with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in advanced-stage TNBC have yielded promising results, indicating the potential benefit of immunotherapy for patients with TNBC. In this Review, we discuss the most relevant molecular findings in TNBC from the past decade and the most promising therapeutic opportunities derived from these data.},

It is generally thought that type I collagen provides the primary elastic strength to tendon while proteoglycans, such as decorin, play a role in failure and viscoelastic properties. This study sought to quantify such structure-function relationships by comparing tendon mechanical properties between normal mice and mice genetically engineered for altered type I collagen content and absence of decorin. Uniaxial tensile ramp to failure experiments were performed on tail tendon fascicles at two strain rates, 0.5\%/s and 50\%/s. Mutations in type I collagen led to reduced failure load and stiffness with no changes in failure stress, modulus or strain rate sensitivity. Fascicles without decorin had similar elastic properties to normal fascicles, but reduced strain rate sensitivity. Fascicles from immature mice, with increased decorin content compared to adult fascicles, had inferior elastic properties but higher strain rate sensitivity. These results showed that tendon viscoelasticity is affected by decorin content but not by collagen alterations. This study provides quantitative evidence for structure-function relationships in tendon, including the role of proteoglycan in viscoelasticity.},

Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a simple damage model to predict mechanical alterations in mouse patellar tendons after aging, injury, or healing. To characterize baseline properties, uninjured controls at age 150 days were cyclically loaded across three strain levels and five frequencies. For comparison, damage was induced in mature (120 day-old) mice through either injury or aging. Injured mice were sacrificed at three or six weeks after surgery, while aged mice were sacrificed at either 300 or 570 days old. Changes in mechanical properties (relative to baseline) in the three week post-injury group were assessed and used to develop an empirical damage model based on a simple damage parameter related to the equilibrium stress at a prescribed strain (6\%). From the derived model, the viscoelastic properties of the 300 day-old, 570 day-old, and six week post-injury groups were accurately predicted. Across testing conditions, nearly all correlations between predicted and measured parameters were statistically significant and coefficients of determination ranged from R2 = 0.25 to 0.97. Results suggest that the proposed damage model could exploit simple in vivo mechanical measurements to predict how an injured or aged tendon will respond to complex physiological loading regimens.},

Several attempts aimed at improving the performance of SIM reconstruction algorithm have been reported.

Although these risk categories are useful for assessing prognosis and risk in groups of patients with breast cancer, their role in determining prognosis and evaluating risk in an individual patient is more limited. Therefore, better methods are required to help assess prognosis and determine the most appropriate treatment for patients on an individual basis. Recently, various molecular techniques, particular gene expression profiling, have been increasingly used to help refine breast cancer classification and to assess prognosis and response to therapy. Although the precise role of these newer techniques in the daily management of patients with breast cancer continues to evolve, it is clear that they have the potential to provide value above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical and pathological prognostic and predictive factors.},

We now wondered whether a similar bias governs nuclear grading in breast carcinoma. An unannounced test was performed at a pathology conference. Pathologists were asked to grade nuclei in a PowerPoint presentation. Circular high power fields of 27 invasive ductal carcinomas were shown, superimposed over low power background images of either tubule-rich or tubule-poor carcinomas. We found (a) that diagnostic reproducibility of nuclear grades was poor to moderate (weighed kappa values between 0.07 and 0.54, 27 cases, 44 graders), but (b) that nuclear grades were not affected by the tumor architecture. We speculate that the categorized grading in breast cancer, separating tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic figure counts in a combined three tier score, prevents the bias that architecture exerts on nuclear grades in less well-controlled situations.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
The notion of local scale was introduced to characterize varying levels of image detail so that localized image processing tasks could be performed while simultaneously yielding a globally optimal result. In this paper, we have presented the methodological framework for a novel locally adaptive scale definition, morphologic scale (MS), which is different from extant local scale definitions in that it attempts to characterize local heterogeneity as opposed to local homogeneity.

Methods:
At every point of interest, the MS is determined as a series of radial paths extending outward in the direction of least resistance, navigating around obstructions. Each pixel can then be directly compared to other points of interest via a rotationally invariant quantitative feature descriptor, determined by the application of Fourier descriptors to the collection of these paths.

Results:
Our goal is to distinguish tumor and stromal tissue classes in the context of four different digitized pathology datasets: prostate tissue microarrays (TMAs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) (44 images) and TMAs stained with only hematoxylin (H) (44 images), slide mounts of ovarian H (60 images), and HE breast cancer (51 images) histology images. Classification performance over 50 cross-validation runs using a Bayesian classifier produced mean areas under the curve of 0.88 ± 0.01 (prostate HE), 0.87 ± 0.02 (prostate H), 0.88 ± 0.01 (ovarian H), and 0.80 ± 0.01 (breast HE).

Conclusion:
For each dataset listed in Table 3, we randomly selected 100 points per image, and using the procedure described in Experiment 1, we attempted to separate them as belonging to stroma or epithelium.},

Near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging is a rapidly growing research field which has the potential to be an important imaging modality in cancer diagnosis. Various exogenous NIR fluorophores have been developed for the technique, including small molecule fluorophores and nanoparticles. NIRF imaging has been used in animal models for the detection of cancer overthe last twenty years and has in recent years been used in human clinical trials.

Areas covered
This article describes the types and characteristics of exogenous fluorophores available for in vivo fluorescent cancer imaging. The article also discusses the progression of NIRF cancer imaging over recent years and its future challenges, from both a biological and clinical perspective. in The review also looks at its application for lymph node mapping, tumor targeting and characterization, and tumor margin definition for surgical guidance.

Expert Opinion
NIRF imaging is not in routine clinical cancer practice; yet, the authors predict that techniques using NIR fluorophores for tumor margin definition and lymph node mapping will enter clinical practice in the near future. The authors also anticipate that NIRF imaging research will lead to the development of flurophores with ‘high brightness’ that will overcome the limited penetration of this modality and be better suited for non invasive tumor targeting},

	abstract = {Environment determines the risk of both prostate and breast cancer, and this risk can vary \&gt;10-fold. In contrast, no risk exists for human seminal vesicle cancer demonstrating tissue specificity. There is also species specificity, because there is no risk for prostate cancer in any other aging mammal except the dog. A study of evolution indicates that the prostate and breast appeared at the same time 65 million years ago with the development of mammals. All male mammals have a prostate; however, the seminal vesicles are variable and are determined by the diet so that species primarily eating meat do not have seminal vesicles. The exception is the human, who has seminal vesicles and consumes meat, although this is a recent dietary change. Human lineage departed from other higher primates 8 million years ago. The closest existing primate to humans is the bonobo (pigmy chimpanzee), which does not eat meat but exists primarily on a high fruit and fresh vegetable diet. Homo sapiens evolved only about 150,000 years ago, and only in the last 10\% of that time (10 to 15 thousand years ago) did humans and dogs dramatically alter their diets. This is the time when humans domesticated the dog, bred animals, grew crops, and cooked, processed, and stored meats and vegetables. All current epidemiologic evidence and suggestions for preventing prostate and breast cancer in humans indicates that we should return to the original diets under which our ancestors evolved. The recent development of the Western-type diet is associated with breast and prostate cancer throughout the world. It is believed that the exposure to and metabolism of estrogens, and the dietary intake of phytoestrogens, combined with fat intake, obesity, and burned food processing may all be related to hormonal carcinogenesis and oxidative DNA damage. An explanatory model is proposed.},

	abstract = {Not long ago it was thought that the most important characteristics of the mechanics of soft tissues were their complex mechanical properties: they often exhibit nonlinear, anisotropic, nearly incompressible, viscoelastic behavior over finite strains. Indeed, these properties endow soft tissues with unique structural capabilities that continue to be extremely challenging to quantify via constitutive relations. More recently, however, we have come to appreciate an even more important characteristic of soft tissues, their homeostatic tendency to adapt in response to changes in their mechanical environment. Thus, to understand well the biomechanical properties of a soft tissue, we must not only quantify their structure and function at a given time, we must also quantify how their structure and function change in response to altered stimuli. In this paper, we introduce a new constrained mixture theory model for studying growth and remodeling of soft tissues. The model melds ideas from classical mixture and homogenization theories so as to exploit advantages of each while avoiding particular difficulties. Salient features include the kinetics of the production and removal of individual constituents and recognition that the neighborhood of a material point of each constituent can have a different, evolving natural (i.e. stress-free) configuration.},

	abstract = {Muscle fiber images play an important role in the medical diagnosis and treatment of many muscular diseases. The number of nuclei in skeletal muscle fiber images is a key bio-marker of the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. In nuclei segmentation one primary challenge is to correctly separate the clustered nuclei. In this article, we developed an image processing pipeline to automatically detect, segment, and analyze nuclei in microscopic image of muscle fibers. The pipeline consists of image pre-processing, identification of isolated nuclei, identification and segmentation of clustered nuclei, and quantitative analysis. Nuclei are initially extracted from background by using local Otsu's threshold. Based on analysis of morphological features of the isolated nuclei, including their areas, compactness, and major axis lengths, a Bayesian network is trained and applied to identify isolated nuclei from clustered nuclei and artifacts in all the images. Then a two-step refined watershed algorithm is applied to segment clustered nuclei. After segmentation, the nuclei can be quantified for statistical analysis. Comparing the segmented results with those of manual analysis and an existing technique, we find that our proposed image processing pipeline achieves good performance with high accuracy and precision. The presented image processing pipeline can therefore help biologists increase their throughput and objectivity in analyzing large numbers of nuclei in muscle fiber images. Microsc. Res.

	abstract = {Background:
Cytological grading is a useful tool for selection of therapy and prognosis in breast carcinoma. Despite having many cytological grading systems, there is still no agreement among pathologists to accept one of them as a gold standard.

Aim:
This study was undertaken to evaluate six such three-tier cytological grading systems to determine which system corresponds best to histological grading done by Nottingham modification of Scarff Bloom Richardson (SBR)'s method.

Materials and Methods:
In a double-blind study, preoperative cytological grades obtained by six systems on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears were compared by testing concordance, association and correlation with histological grade derived postoperatively by the SBR's method in 57 patients of breast carcinoma. Bivariate correlation studies and multiple linear regressions were done to assess the significance of the different cytological parameters to predict final cytological grades.

Results:
Robinson's system demonstrated the best correlation (ρ = 0.799; P = 0.000 and τ = 0.765; P = 0.000), maximum percent agreement (77.19\%) and a substantial kappa value of agreement (κ = 0.62) with the SBR's grading system. All the six cytological grading systems correlated with histological grading strongly and positively. In multiple regression analysis, all of the cytological parameters of Robinson's system except cell size and nucleoli had significance in predicting the final cytological grade.

Conclusions:
Robinson's grading system is simple, more objective and reproducible, and demonstrated the best concordance with histological grading. So, Robinson's system should be used routinely for breast carcinoma aspirates.},

	abstract = {Rapid assessment of prostate core biopsy pathology at the point-of-procedure could provide benefit in a variety of clinical situations. Even with advanced transrectal ultrasound guidance and saturation biopsy protocols, prostate cancer can be missed in up to half of all initial biopsy procedures. In addition, collection of tumor specimens for downstream histologic, molecular, and genetic analysis is hindered by low tumor yield due to inability to identify prostate cancer grossly. However, current point-of-procedure pathology protocols, such as frozen section analysis (FSA), are destructive and too time- and labor-intensive to be practical or economical. Ex vivo microscopy of the excised specimens, stained with fast-acting fluorescent histology dyes, could be an attractive nondestructive alternative to FSA. In this work, we report the first demonstration of video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) for rapid high-resolution diagnostic imaging of prostate biopsies in realistic point-of-procedure timeframes. Large mosaic images of prostate biopsies stained with acridine orange are rendered in seconds and contain excellent contrast and detail, exhibiting close correlation with corresponding hematoxylin and eosin histology. A clinically relevant review of VR-SIM images of 34 unfixed and uncut prostate core biopsies by two independent pathologists resulted in an area under the receiver operative curve (AUC) of 0.82–0.88, with a sensitivity ranging from 63\% to 88\% and a specificity ranging from 78\% to 89\%. When biopsies contained more than 5\% tumor content, the sensitivity improved to 75\% to 92\%. The image quality, speed, minimal complexity, and ease of use of VR-SIM could prove to be features in favor of adoption as an alternative to destructive pathology at the point-of-procedure.

	abstract = {Automatic grading systems based on histopathological slide images are applied to various types of cancers. To date, cancer scientists and researchers have conducted many experiments to find and evaluate new and innovative automatic cancer grading systems to accelerate their therapeutic diagnoses and ultimately to enable more efficient prognoses. The previously proposed automatic or computer-aided systems for breast cancer grading, including specializing mitosis counting, suffer from various shortcomings. The most important one is their low efficiency along with high complexity due to the huge amount of features. In this paper, three types of features with more flexibility and less complexity are employed. These features are: completed local binary pattern (CLBP) as textural features, statistical moment entropy (SME) and stiffness matrix (SM) as a mathematical model which includes geometric, morphometric and shape-based features. In the proposed automatic mitosis detection method, these three types of features are fused with each other. The SM feature comprises of characteristics which are to be extracted for reliable discrimination of mitosis objects from non-mitosis ones. The evaluations are applied over histology datasets A and H provided by the Mitos-ICPR2012 contest sponsors. Employing both a nonlinear radial basis function (RBF) kernel for support vector machine (SVM) and also random forest classifiers, leads to the best efficiencies among the other competitive methods which have been proposed in the past. The results are in the form of F-measure criterion which is a basis for bioinformatics assessments and evaluation.},

	abstract = {While there is a significant amount of information available on the clinical presentation(s) and pathological changes associated with tendinopathy, the precise aetiopathogenesis of this condition remains a topic of debate. Classically, the aetiology of tendinopathy has been linked to the performance of repetitive activities (so-called overuse injuries). This has led many investigators to suggest that it is the mechanobiologic over-stimulation of tendon cells that is the initial stimulus for the degradative processes which have been shown to accompany tendinopathy. Although several studies have been able to demonstrate that the in vitro over-stimulation of tendon cells in monolayer can result in a pattern(s) of gene expression seen in clinical cases of tendinopathy, the strain magnitudes and durations used in these in vitro studies, as well as the model systems, may not be clinically relevant. Using a rat tail tendon model, we have studied the in vitro mechanobiologic response of tendon cells in situ to various tensile loading regimes. These studies have led to the hypothesis that the aetiopathogenic stimulus for the degenerative cascade which precedes the overt pathologic development of tendinopathy is the catabolic response of tendon cells to mechanobiologic under-stimulation as a result of microscopic damage to the collagen fibres of the tendon. In this review, we examine the rationale for this hypothesis and provide evidence in support of this theory.},

	abstract = {Background:
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a quick, minimally invasive procedure for evaluation of breast tumors. The Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade on histological sections is a well-established tool to guide selection of adjuvant systemic therapy. Grade evaluation is possible on cytology smears to avoid and minimize the morbidity associated with overtreatment of lower grade tumors.

Aim:
The aim was to test the hypothesis whether breast FNA from the peripheral portion of the lesion is representative of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade on histopathology as compared to FNA from the central portion.

Materials and Methods:
Fine-needle aspirates and subsequent tissue specimens from 45 women with ductal carcinoma (not otherwise specified) were studied. FNAs were performed under ultrasound guidance from the central as well as the peripheral third of the lesion for each case avoiding areas of necrosis/calcification. The SBR grading was compared on alcohol fixed aspirates and tissue sections for each case.

Results:
Comparative analysis of SBR grade on aspirates from the peripheral portion and histopathology by the Pearson chi-square test (χ2 =78.00) showed that it was statistically significant (P{\textless}0.001) with 93\% concordance. Lower mitotic score on aspirates from the peripheral portion was observed in only 4 out of 45 (9\%) cases. The results of the Pearson chi-square test (χ2 = 75.824) with statistically significant (P=0.000).

Conclusion:
This prospective study shows that FNA smears from the peripheral portion of the lesion are representative of the grading performed on the corresponding histopathological sections. It is possible to score and grade by SBR system on FNA smears.},

	abstract = {The standard approach to breast-conserving surgery is wide local excision of the tumor and radiotherapy. However, a significant number of patients require further surgery to obtain oncologically clear margins, and may obtain a poor cosmetic result following adjuvant radiotherapy. Oncoplastic techniques may result in improved cosmesis, but few studies have investigated the oncological advantage of this approach. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare tumor clearance and the need for further margin excision following standard wide local excision (group A, 121 patients), and oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery (group B, 37 patients). These techniques included therapeutic mammoplasty, sub-axillary fat pad rotation mammoplasty, thoraco-epigastric flap, and central flap. Compared to standard surgery (group A), oncoplastic techniques (group B) can be employed for significantly larger tumors (17.6 mm versus 23.9 mm, p = 0.002). Oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery results in higher mean specimen weights (58.1 g versus 231.1 g, p {\textless} 0.0001), higher specimen volumes (112.3 cm3 versus 484.5 cm3, p {\textless} 0.0001), and wider clear margins (6.1 mm versus 14.3 mm, p {\textless} 0.0001), resulting in lower rates of further surgery (28.9\% versus 5.4\%, p = 0.002). There was no statistical increase in complication rates following oncoplastic surgery. Oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery is more successful than standard wide local excision in treating larger tumors and obtaining wider radial margins, thus reducing the need for further margin excision, which delays adjuvant therapy. There was no increase in postoperative complication rate using an oncoplastic approach.},

We introduced cavity shaving at primary surgery 31 months ago, to assess tumor margin involvement. The aim of this study was to determine how cavity shaving affects the re-excision rate. We compared a group of 394 patients who underwent BCS with cavity shaving of macroscopically clear margins at primary operation, from March 2003 to September 2005 with a group of 392 patients who underwent BCS only from January 2000 to February 2003. Cavity shaves and re-excision specimens were measured and oriented with reference to the primary cancer. Pathological results of all the specimens were analyzed and re-excision rates in both groups were recorded. Compared with BCS alone where 49 of 392 patients (12.5\%) required reoperation for margin clearance, only 22 of 394 patients (5.58\%) of the group who had concurrent cavity shaves required further surgery (p {\textless} 0.01). Analysis of re-excised specimens suggests that reoperation could have been avoided in 44 of 49 patients, if they had standard sized cavity shave at primary operation. We conclude that cavity shavings during primary BCS significantly reduce the re-excision rate to ensure microscopic clearance.},

Overall cancer incidence trends (13 oldest SEER registries) are stable in women, but declining by 3.1\% per year in men (from 2009-2012), much of which is because of recent rapid declines in prostate cancer diagnoses. The cancer death rate has dropped by 23\% since 1991, translating to more than 1.7 million deaths averted through 2012. Despite this progress, death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and uterine corpus, and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states, primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease. Among children and adolescents (aged birth-19 years), brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death because of the dramatic therapeutic advances against leukemia.

Here, we have synthesized a thin PLGA film coating with a highly ordered microporous structure using a simple and inexpensive water templating “breath figure” technique. A single stage process combining spin coating and breath figure process was used to obtain drug incorporated porous thin films. The films were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the surface and bulk features of porosity and also, degradation pattern of the films. Moreover, the effect of addition of small amount of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) into PLGA was characterized. SEM analysis revealed an ordered array of {\textasciitilde}2 µm sized pores on the surface with the average film thickness measured to be 20 µm. The incorporation of hydrophilic poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) enhances pore structure uniformity and facilitates ingress of water into the structure. A five week in vitro degradation study showed a gradual deterioration of the breath figure pores. During the course of degradation, the surface pore structure deteriorates to initially flatten the surface. This is followed by the formation of new pinprick pores that eventually grow into a macroporous film prior to film breakup. Salicylic acid (highly water soluble) and Ibuprofen (sparingly water soluble) were chosen as model drug compounds to characterize release rates, which are higher in films of the breath figure morphology rather than in non-porous films. The results are of significance in the design of biodegradable films used as coatings to modulate delivery.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading type of malignant tumor observed in women and the effective treatment depends on its early diagnosis. Diagnosis from histopathological images remains the "gold standard" for breast cancer. The complexity of breast cell histopathology (BCH) images makes reliable segmentation and classification hard. In this paper, an automatic quantitative image analysis technique of BCH images is proposed. For the nuclei segmentation, top-bottom hat transform is applied to enhance image quality. Wavelet decomposition and multi-scale region-growing (WDMR) are combined to obtain regions of interest (ROIs) thereby realizing precise location. A double-strategy splitting model (DSSM) containing adaptive mathematical morphology and Curvature Scale Space (CSS) corner detection method is applied to split overlapped cells for better accuracy and robustness. For the classification of cell nuclei, 4 shape-based features and 138 textural features based on color spaces are extracted. Optimal feature set is obtained by support vector machine (SVM) with chain-like agent genetic algorithm (CAGA). The proposed method was tested on 68 BCH images containing more than 3600 cells. Experimental results show that the mean segmentation sensitivity was 91.53\% (±4.05\%) and specificity was 91.64\% (±4.07\%). The classification performance of normal and malignant cell images can achieve 96.19\% (±0.31\%) for accuracy, 99.05\% (±0.27\%) for sensitivity and 93.33\% (±0.81\%) for specificity.},

Mutant strains lacking BrpA also display increased autolysis and decreased viability, suggesting a role for BrpA in cell envelope integrity. In this study, we examined the impact of BrpA deficiency on cell envelope stresses induced by envelope-active antimicrobials. Compared to the wild-type strain UA159, the BrpA-deficient mutant (TW14D) was significantly more susceptible to antimicrobial agents, especially lipid II inhibitors. Several genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis were identified by DNA microarray analysis as downregulated in TW14D. Luciferase reporter gene fusion assays also revealed that expression of brpA is regulated in response to environmental conditions and stresses induced by exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of cell envelope antimicrobials. In a Galleria mellonella (wax worm) model, BrpA deficiency was shown to diminish the virulence of S. mutans OMZ175, which, unlike S. mutans UA159, efficiently kills the worms. Collectively, these results suggest that BrpA plays a role in the regulation of cell envelope integrity and that deficiency of BrpA adversely affects the fitness and diminishes the virulence of OMZ175, a highly invasive strain of S. mutans.},

	abstract = {Background   Efforts to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa) are relevant. Gleason score (GSc) overestimation may subject individuals to unnecessary aggressive treatment. We aimed to use stereology in PCa evaluations and investigate whether mean nuclear volume (MNV) correlates with the Gleason primary pattern (Gpp) and to improve the subjective GSc to obtain an objective and reliable method without inter-observer dissension.      Methods   We identified 74 radical prostatectomy specimens that were divided into six groups based on Gpp, from 3 to 5. Controls (C) were designed in paired non-tumor regions of the same specimens. MNV was estimated using the “point-sampled intercepts” method. Differences in MNV among the C groups and the Gpp groups were tested with the Kruskall-Wallis test and Dunn post-hoc test. Differences between each Gpp group and its control counterpart were tested with the Wilcoxon test. Correlations were evaluated with the Spearman rank correlation (R [Spearman] ).      Results   The correlations between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and GSc (R [Spearman]  of 0.76) and between PSA and MNV (R [Spearman]  of 0.78) were moderately strong and highly significant, and the correlation between MNV and Gpp (R [Spearman]  of 0.53) was moderate and highly significant. MNV was significantly greater in cancerous regions than in paired-control regions. Limitations included sample size.      Conclusions   Proper planning of a study, as well as the availability of equipment and software for morphological quantification, can provide incentive to quickly and accurately estimate MNV as an adjunct parameter in the assessment of PCa. Current data are in favor of the use of MNV associated with GSc and PSA in the assessment of PCa.},

One hundred sixteen cytologically malignant breast tumour cases were included in this study and correlated with paraffin embedded sections. Breast lumps were varied from less than 1 cm to 11 cm in greatest dimension. FNA was performed from different sites of the breast lump, and smears were stained with Giemsa and H\&E stain and evaluated for cytological grading according to Robinson's grading system. Paraffin embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain and graded according to modified Bloom-Richardson grading system. Comparison between these two grading systems was done. Results. Cytologically grade I, grade II, and grade III cases were 13.8\%, 64.65\%, and 21.55\%, respectively. Histologically 25\%, 54.31\%, and 20.69\% cases were grade I, grade II, and grade III, respectively. Concordance rate between cytology and histology of grade I, grade II, and grade III tumors was 75\%, 70.67\%, and 60\% respectively. The absolute concordance rate was 68.97\%. Conclusion. In the era of multiple treatment modalities and neoadjuvant therapy, cytological grading can be used as a prognostic factor for better management of patients.},

	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of automated image acquisition systems is enabling new types of microscopy experiments that generate large image datasets. However, there is a perceived lack of robust image analysis systems required to process these diverse datasets. Most automated image analysis systems are tailored for specific types of microscopy, contrast methods, probes, and even cell types. This imposes significant constraints on experimental design, limiting their application to the narrow set of imaging methods for which they were designed. One of the approaches to address these limitations is pattern recognition, which was originally developed for remote sensing, and is increasingly being applied to the biology domain. This approach relies on training a computer to recognize patterns in images rather than developing algorithms or tuning parameters for specific image processing tasks. The generality of this approach promises to enable data mining in extensive image repositories, and provide objective and quantitative imaging assays for routine use. Here, we provide a brief overview of the technologies behind pattern recognition and its use in computer vision for biological and biomedical imaging. We list available software tools that can be used by biologists and suggest practical experimental considerations to make the best use of pattern recognition techniques for imaging assays.},

Complete prostates were obtained at autopsy from 281 men (aged 20–84 years) who died in traffic accidents and presented no clinical symptoms of prostatic disease. The prostates were classified as: histologically normal (n=182), with nodular hyperplasia (n=42), with intraepithelial neoplasia (n=40) and carcinomatous with low Gleason grade (n=20). Each prostate was divided into three regions (periurethral, central and peripheral) and the volume of each region, as well as the average volume occupied by stroma and epithelium in each region were quantified. For each parameter, the average values for each age group were compared. In the histologically normal prostates, an increase with ageing in the total volume and the volume occupied by the central region were observed; these increases were mainly caused by an increase in the stromal volume of the central region in men after 30 years of age. No histologically normal prostates were found in men older than 70 years of age. Nodular prostatic hyperplasia was found in men over 30 years of age and a fluctuation in the total volume throughout ageing was observed. Prostates with intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and carcinoma were observed in men aged {\textgreater}20 years and the total volume and those of each prostatic region showed multiple variations, except for the eighth decade where a marked increase with regard to that of the previous decades was observed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is common practice for unifocal ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) less than 4 cm in size, but the extent of tumor free margin width around DCIS necessary to minimize recurrence is unclear.
METHODS
Clinical and pathologic details were recorded from all patients with pure DCIS {\textless} 4 cm in size, treated with BCS between 1978 and 1997. Histologic margins were measured by using an ocular micrometer. Patients with clear margins ({\textgreater} 1 mm) were divided up into 3 groups for analysis based on margin of normal tissue excised: 1.1–5 mm, 5.1–10 mm, and 10.1–40 mm.
RESULTS
There were 66 patients with close margins (≤ 1 mm), of which 25 cases (37.9\%) recurred. The recurrence rates for the 3 clear margin groups ranged from 4.5–7.1\%. Median followup was 47 months (range 12–197 mos). Risk of recurrence in the group with close margins was greater than the subgroups with clear margins (P {\textless} 0.001); no differences in recurrence was seen between the individual subgroups with clear margins. Nuclear Grade 3 was predictive of recurrence (P = 0.03). Following excision alone, the recurrence rate was 18.6\%, compared with 11.1\% when radiotherapy was given as adjuvant therapy. Women with clear margins following excision had a recurrence rate of only 8.1\%.
CONCLUSION
After BCS for DCIS, close margins were associated with a high risk of local recurrence. Radiotherapy did not compensate for inadequate surgical clearance. Cancer 2001;91:9–16. © 2001 American Cancer Society.},

The confounder tissue classes can often mimic and share attributes with both the diseased and normal tissue classes, and can be particularly difficult to identify, both manually and by automated classifiers. In the case of prostate cancer, they may be several confounding tissue types present in a biopsy sample, posing as major sources of diagnostic error for pathologists. Two common multi-class approaches are one-shot classification (OSC), where all classes are identified simultaneously, and one-versus-all (OVA), where a “target” class is distinguished from all “non-target” classes. OSC is typically unable to handle discrimination of classes of varying similarity (e.g. with images of prostate atrophy and high grade cancer), while OVA forces several heterogeneous classes into a single “non-target” class. In this work, we present a cascaded (CAS) approach to classifying prostate biopsy tissue samples, where images from different classes are grouped to maximize intra-group homogeneity while maximizing inter-group heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to grade prostate malignancy using digitized histopathological specimens of the prostate tissue. Most of the approaches proposed in the literature to address this problem utilize various textural features computed from the prostate tissue image. Our approach differs in that we only focus on the tissue structure and the well-known Gleason grading system specification. The color space representing the tissue image is investigated and basic components of the prostate tissue are detected. The components and their structural relationship constitute a complete gland region. Tissue structural features extracted from gland morphology are used to classify a tissue pattern into three major categories: benign, grade 3 carcinoma and grade 4 carcinoma. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a texture-based method in the three-class classification problem and most of the two-class classification problems except for the grade 3 vs grade 4 classification. Based on these results, we propose a hierarchical (binary) classification scheme which utilizes the two methods and obtains 85.6\% accuracy in classifying an input tissue pattern into one of the three classes.},

	abstract = {Background
We aimed to evaluate the differences in the rates and predictive factors for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) between ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer. And, we evaluated the impact of IBTR on overall survival and distant metastasis.

Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 322 consecutive patients with DCIS or invasive breast cancer who underwent BCS between 2004 and 2010. We evaluated the rates of IBTR of DCIS and invasive breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors for IBTR, and survival rates were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Results
With a median follow-up period of 57 months, 5 (10 \%) out of 50 DCIS patients and 14 (5.1 \%) out of 272 invasive cancer patients had developed IBTR. Factors associated with IBTR on univariate and multivariate analyses were positive resection margin status in DCIS and omission of radiotherapy in invasive cancer, respectively. The hormone receptor negativity was strong independent predictive factors for IBTR in both DCIS and invasive breast cancer. Although the differences of survival curve did not reach statistical significance, the 5-year overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival of invasive cancer patients who suffered IBTR were inferior to those without (84 vs. 98 \% and 63.3 vs. 96.5 \%, respectively). Advanced initial stage, lymph node metastasis and experience of IBTR were associated with poor overall survival and distant metastasis on univariate and multivariate analyses.

Conclusions
The hormone receptor negativity was revealed as independent predictive factor for IBTR after BCS in both DCIS and invasive cancer. Experience of IBTR was independent prognostic factor for poor overall outcome in patients with invasive breast cancer. Aggressive local control and adjuvant therapy should be made in hormone receptor-negative patients who receive treatment with BCS.},

	abstract = {Mechanical forces are closely involved in the construction of an embryo. Experiments have suggested that mechanical feedback plays a role in regulating these forces, but the nature of this feedback is poorly understood. Here, we propose a general principle for the mechanics of morphogenesis, as governed by a pair of evolution equations based on feedback from tissue stress. In one equation, the rate of growth (or contraction) depends on the difference between the current tissue stress and a target (homeostatic) stress. In the other equation, the target stress changes at a rate that depends on the same stress difference. The parameters in these morphomechanical laws are assumed to depend on stress rate. Computational models are used to illustrate how these equations can capture a relatively wide range of behaviours observed in developing embryos, as well as show the limitations of this theory. Specific applications include growth of pressure vessels (e.g. the heart, arteries and brain), wound healing and sea urchin gastrulation. Understanding the fundamental principles of tissue construction can help engineers design new strategies for creating replacement tissues and organs in vitro.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Pyff, the Pythonic feedback framework for feedback applications and stimulus presentation. Pyff provides a platform-independent framework that allows users to develop and run neuroscientific experiments in the programming language Python. Existing solutions have mostly been implemented in C++, which makes for a rather tedious programming task for non-computer-scientists, or in Matlab, which is not well suited for more advanced visual or auditory applications. Pyff was designed to make experimental paradigms (i.e., feedback and stimulus applications) easily programmable. It includes base classes for various types of common feedbacks and stimuli as well as useful libraries for external hardware such as eyetrackers. Pyff is also equipped with a steadily growing set of ready-to-use feedbacks and stimuli. It can be used as a standalone application, for instance providing stimulus presentation in psychophysics experiments, or within a closed loop such as in biofeedback or brain–computer interfacing experiments. Pyff communicates with other systems via a standardized communication protocol and is therefore suitable to be used with any system that may be adapted to send its data in the specified format. Having such a general, open-source framework will help foster a fruitful exchange of experimental paradigms between research groups. In particular, it will decrease the need of reprogramming standard paradigms, ease the reproducibility of published results, and naturally entail some standardization of stimulus presentation.},

There was a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) increase in the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (NCR) with depth within the epithelium in normal tissues; however, there was no significant change in NCR with depth in precancerous tissues. The redox ratio significantly decreased in the less differentiated basal epithelial cells compared with the more mature cells in the superficial layer of the normal stratified squamous epithelium, indicating an increase in metabolic activity in cells with increased NCR. However, the redox ratio was not significantly different between the superficial and basal cells in precancerous tissues. A significant decrease was observed in the contribution and lifetime of protein-bound NADH (averaged over the entire epithelium) in both low- and high-grade epithelial precancers compared with normal epithelial tissues. In addition, a significant increase in the protein-bound FAD lifetime and a decrease in the contribution of protein-bound FAD are observed in high-grade precancers only. Increased intracellular variability in the redox ratio, NADH, and FAD fluorescence lifetimes were observed in precancerous cells compared with normal cells.},

This study investigates the ability of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), an emerging imaging tool, to image the morphology of neoplastic and non-neoplastic breast tissues, and determines the ability of histopathologists and surgeons to differentiate these images. Freshly excised tumour samples and adjacent non-diseased sections from 50 consenting patients were stained with 0.01 \% acriflavine hydrochloride and imaged using pCLE. All discernible pCLE features were cross-examined with conventional histopathology. Following pattern recognition training, 17 histopathologists and surgeons with no pCLE experience interpreted 50 pCLE images independently whilst blinded to histopathology results. Three-hundred and fifty pCLE image mosaics were analysed. Consistent with histopathology findings, the glandular structures, adipocytes and collagen fibres of normal breast were readily visible on pCLE images. These were distinguishable from the morphological architecture exhibited by invasive and non-invasive carcinoma. The mean accuracy of pCLE image interpretation for histopathologists and surgeons was 94 and 92 \%, respectively. Overall, inter-observer agreement for histopathologists was ‘almost perfect’, κ = 0.82; and ‘substantial’ for surgeons, κ = 0.74. pCLE morphological features of neoplastic and non-neoplastic breast tissues are readily visualized and distinguishable with high accuracy by both histopathologists and surgeons. Further research is required to investigate a potential role for the use of pCLE intraoperatively for in situ detection of residual cancerous foci, thereby guiding operating decision-making based on real-time breast cavity scanning.},

However, the role of interleukins on normal tendon activity remains poorly understood. Previous studies that have researched the role of specific cytokines by exogenously applying them have often reported conflicting results. Therefore, a knockout mouse model was used to investigate the role of interleukins 4 and 6 on normal tendon organizational and biomechanical properties. It was hypothesized that interleukin-6 knockout (IL6 -/-) mice will display more organized collagen orientation and greater cross-sectional area and mechanical properties when compared to that of control mice. In addition, interleukin-4 knockout (IL4 -/-) mice will display the most disorganized collagen orientation and lowest cross-sectional area and mechanical properties. As hypothesized, IL6 -/- mice show a trend towards lower angular deviation (more organized) (p\&lt;0.1) when compared to IL4 -/- mice. In addition, the IL6 -/- mice show a trend towards a higher percent relaxation (p\&lt;0.1) and a significantly higher modulus (p\&lt;0.01) when compared to CTL and IL4 -/- mice. Unexpectedly, the IL6 -/- mice exhibited no significant differences in collagen fiber distribution and maximum stress from the other groups and actually had a smaller cross-sectional area than CTL mice (p\&lt;0.1). This study supports transgenic mice as an animal model for investigating how cytokines affect normal tendon properties. In addition, this study demonstrates that interleukins may play an important role in tendon development, function, and maintenance.},

	abstract = {Purpose Histopathology is the clinical standard for tissue diagnosis; however, it requires tissue processing, laboratory personnel and infrastructure, and a highly trained pathologist to diagnose the tissue. Optical microscopy can provide real-time diagnosis, which could be used to inform the management of breast cancer. The goal of this work is to obtain images of tissue morphology through fluorescence microscopy and vital fluorescent stains and to develop a strategy to segment and quantify breast tissue features in order to enable automated tissue diagnosis. Methods We combined acriflavine staining, fluorescence microscopy, and a technique called sparse component analysis to segment nuclei and nucleoli, which are collectively referred to as acriflavine positive features (APFs). A series of variables, which included the density, area fraction, diameter, and spacing of APFs, were quantified from images taken from clinical core needle breast biopsies and used to create a multivariate classification model. The model was developed using a training data set and validated using an independent testing data set. Results The top performing classification model included the density and area fraction of smaller APFs (those less than 7 µm in diameter, which likely correspond to stained nucleoli).When applied to the independent testing set composed of 25 biopsy panels, the model achieved a sensitivity of 82 \%, a specificity of 79 \%, and an overall accuracy of 80 \%. Conclusions These results indicate that our quantitative microscopy toolbox is a potentially viable approach for detecting the presence of malignancy in clinical core needle breast biopsies.},

	volume = {27},
	issn = {0021-9290},
	abstract = {Growth and remodeling in tissues may be modulated by mechanical factors such as stress. For example, in cardiac hypertrophy, alterations in wall stress arising from changes in mechanical loading lead to cardiac growth and remodeling. A general continuum formulation for finite volumetric growth in soft elastic tissues is therefore proposed. The shape change of an unloaded tissue during growth is described by a mapping analogous to the deformation gradient tensor. This mapping is decomposed into a transformation of the local zero-stress reference state and an accompanying elastic deformation that ensures the compatibility of the total growth deformation. Residual stress arises from this elastic deformation. Hence, a complete kinematic formulation for growth in general requires a knowledge of the constitutive law for stress in the tissue. Since growth may in turn be affected by stress in the tissue, a general form for the stress-dependent growth law is proposed as a relation between the symmetric growth-rate tensor and the stress tensor. With a thick-walled hollow cylinder of incompressible, isotropic hyperelastic material as an example, the mechanics of left ventricular hypertrophy are investigated. The results show that transmurally uniform pure circumferential growth, which may be similar to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, changes the state of residual stress in the heart wall. A model of axially loaded bone is used to test a simple stress-dependent growth law in which growth rate depends on the difference between the stress due to loading and a predetermined growth equilibrium stress.},

	abstract = {Background
Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target.

Methods
We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method.

Results
A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p {\textless} 0.05).

Conclusions
This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning.},

	abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) results from a multistep process. This process includes initiation, which occurs through various aging events and multiple insults (such as chronic infection, inflammation and genetic instability through reactive oxygen species causing DNA double-strand breaks), followed by a multistep process of progression. These steps include several genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as alterations to the chromatin structure, which occur in response to the carcinogenic stress-related events that sustain proliferative signaling. Events such as evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis are readily observed. In addition, in conjunction with these critical drivers of carcinogenesis, other factors related to the etiopathogenesis of PCa, involving energy metabolism and evasion of the immune surveillance system, appear to be involved. In addition, when cancer spread and metastasis occur, the 'tumor microenvironment' in the bone of PCa patients may provide a way to sustain dormancy or senescence and eventually establish a 'seed and soil' site where PCa proliferation and growth may occur over time. When PCa is initiated and progression ensues, significant alterations in nuclear size, shape and heterochromatin (DNA transcription) organization are found, and key nuclear transcriptional and structural proteins, as well as multiple nuclear bodies can lead to precancerous and malignant changes. These series of cellular and tissue-related malignancy-associated events can be quantified to assess disease progression and management.},

	abstract = {The major challenge faced by today’s pharmacologist and formulation scientist is ocular drug delivery. Topical eye drop is the most convenient and patient compliant route of drug administration, especially for the treatment of anterior segment diseases. Delivery of drugs to the targeted ocular tissues is restricted by various precorneal, dynamic and static ocular barriers. Also, therapeutic drug levels are not maintained for longer duration in target tissues. In the past two decades, ocular drug delivery research acceleratedly advanced towards developing a novel, safe and patient compliant formulation and drug delivery devices/techniques, which may surpass these barriers and maintain drug levels in tissues. Anterior segment drug delivery advances are witnessed by modulation of conventional topical solutions with permeation and viscosity enhancers. Also, it includes development of conventional topical formulations such as suspensions, emulsions and ointments. Various nanoformulations have also been introduced for anterior segment ocular drug delivery. On the other hand, for posterior ocular delivery, research has been immensely focused towards development of drug releasing devices and nanoformulations for treating chronic vitreoretinal diseases. These novel devices and/or formulations may help to surpass ocular barriers and associated side effects with conventional topical drops. Also, these novel devices and/or formulations are easy to formulate, no/negligibly irritating, possess high precorneal residence time, sustain the drug release, and enhance ocular bioavailability of therapeutics. An update of current research advancement in ocular drug delivery necessitates and helps drug delivery scientists to modulate their think process and develop novel and safe drug delivery strategies. Current review intends to summarize the existing conventional formulations for ocular delivery and their advancements followed by current nanotechnology based formulation developments. Also, recent developments with other ocular drug delivery strategies employing in situ gels, implants, contact lens and microneedles have been discussed.},

This derivative is reactive towards nucleophiles including amine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins.
A succinimidyl-ester functional group attached to the fluorescein core, creating "NHS-fluorescein", forms another common amine reactive derivative that has much greater specificity toward primary amines in the presence of other nucleophiles.
FITC has excitation and emission spectrum peak wavelengths of approximately 495 nm/519 nm. Like most fluorochromes, it is prone to photobleaching. Because of the problem with photobleaching, derivatives of fluorescein such as Alexa 488 and DyLight 488 have been tailored for various chemical and biological applications where greater photostability, higher fluorescence intensity, or different attachment groups are needed.},

An algorithm based on sparse component analysis (SCA) and the circle transform (CT) was developed for image segmentation and quantification of distinct tissue types. The accuracy of our approach was quantified through simulations of tumor and muscle images. Specifically, tumor, muscle, and tumor+muscle tissue images were simulated because these tissue types were most commonly observed in sarcoma margins. Simulations were based on tissue characteristics observed in pathology slides. The potential clinical utility of our approach was evaluated by imaging excised margins and the tumor bed in a cohort of mice after surgical resection of sarcoma.ResultsSimulation experiments revealed that SCA+CT achieved the lowest errors for larger nuclear sizes and for higher contrast ratios (nuclei intensity/background intensity). For imaging of tumor margins, SCA+CT effectively isolated nuclei from tumor, muscle, adipose, and tumor+muscle tissue types. Differences in density were correctly identified with SCA+CT in a cohort of ex vivo and in vivo images, thus illustrating the diagnostic potential of our approach.ConclusionThe combination of a subcellular-resolution microendoscope, acriflavine staining, and SCA+CT can be used to accurately isolate nuclei and quantify their density in anatomical images of heterogeneous tissue.},

The past two decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to model brain signals recorded by electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, etc., and to derive real-time estimates of user cognitive state, response, or intent for a variety of purposes: to restore communication by the severely disabled, to effect brain-actuated control and, more recently, to augment human–computer interaction. Continuing these advances, largely achieved through increases in computational power and methods, requires software tools to streamline the creation, testing, evaluation and deployment of new data analysis methods. Approach. Here we present BCILAB, an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox built to address the need for the development and testing of brain-computer interface (BCI) methods by providing an organized collection of over 100 pre-implemented methods and method variants, an easily extensible framework for the rapid prototyping of new methods, and a highly automated framework for systematic testing and evaluation of new implementations. Main results. To validate and illustrate the use of the framework, we present two sample analyses of publicly available data sets from recent BCI competitions and from a rapid serial visual presentation task. We demonstrate the straightforward use of BCILAB to obtain results compatible with the current BCI literature. Significance. The aim of the BCILAB toolbox is to provide the BCI community a powerful toolkit for methods research and evaluation, thereby helping to accelerate the pace of innovation in the field, while complementing the existing spectrum of tools for real-time BCI experimentation, deployment and use.},

	abstract = {A big part of Dr. Joe's job as director of McGill University's Office of Science and Society is persuading people that the pursuit of science knowledge is a potential source of wonder, enlightenment and well-being for everyone. And as a chemist, he's particularly keen to rescue chemistry from the bad rep it's developed over recent decades. There is more to chemistry than toxins, pollution, and "Don't drink that soda--it's full of chemicals." The evangelic zeal Dr. Joe brings to his day job is of course also the driving force behind his work as an author. Once again, here he is to tell that everything is full of chemicals, and that chemistry means health, nutrition, beauty products, cleaning products, DNA, and the means by which Lady Gaga's meat dress was held together. In the style established with the bestselling Brain Fuel, each section here is themed and contains a mixture of short, pithy items and slightly longer mini-essays. And as before--but never with such energy and relish--Dr. Joe goes on the attack against charlatans in the alternative health trade, naming and shaming them in a particularly entertaining and edifying section of the book called "Claptrap."You will learn whether to put broccoli on a pizza before or after baking, whether beauty pills are worth taking, and whether the baby shampoo you're using is poisonous. You will discover but not use, please, the recipe for a Molotov cocktail. You will be enabled to enthrall fellow dinner guests with the derivation of the name Persil, and the definition of a kangarian (it's someone who only eats kangaroo meat).As ever, this torrent of entertainment is delivered in Dr. Joe's unmistakably warm, lively and authorative voice.},

Genetic engineering has been used with variable success to design living and non-living systems as a means to deliver antigens to these sites and to stimulate a desired immune response. More recently, plant biotechnology techniques have been used to create plants which contain a gene derived from a human pathogen; the resultant plant tissues will accumulate an antigenic protein encoded by the foreign DNA. In pre-clinical trials, we found that antigenic proteins produced in transgenic plants retained immunogenic properties when purified; if injected into mice the antigen caused production of protein-specific antibodies. Moreover, in some experiments, if the plant tissues were simply fed to mice, a mucosal immune response occurred. The present study was conducted as a proof of principle to determine if humans would also develop a serum and/or mucosal immune response to an antigen delivered in an uncooked foodstuff.},

Patient education and the informed consent process should include a discussion about the importance of margin status. Specimen management is critically important to obtain the highest quality information about margins. Operating technique should avoid trauma to or disruption of the specimen surface. The specimen should be oriented for the pathologist using standard techniques including sutures, clips, or colored inks. Specimen radiography is mandatory to confirm complete resection of the target tissues and can be used to direct additional margin resections during the initial procedure. With a well-designed and oriented specimen, the pathologist can give an accurate description of the margin distance for both the invasive and in situ components of the cancer. In most cases, decision-making about margins will be straightforward. Positive margins should be re-excised or the treatment is converted to mastectomy. Clear margins ({\textgreater}5 mm) require no further surgical therapy. “Close” margins (1–4 mm) will remain a point of controversy because of conflicting reports from clinical series. At UAB, decision for re-excision is made on a case-by-case basis. Routinely 2 mm is considered adequate, however, volume of disease and intraductal component are important considerations when making recommendations.},

Despite these obvious commons features tendons from different locations within the body show remarkable variation in terms of their morphological, molecular and mechanical properties which relates to their specialized function. An appreciation of these differences is necessary to understand all aspects of tendon biology in health and disease. In our work, we have used a combination of mechanical assessment, histological measurements and molecular analysis of matrix in functionally distinct tendons to determine relationships between function and structure. We have found significant differences in material and molecular properties between spring-like tendons that are subjected to high strains during locomotion and positional tendons which are subjected to much lower strains. Furthermore, we have data to suggest that not only is the matrix composition different but also the ability of cells to synthesize and degrade the matrix (matrix turnover) varies between tendon types. We propose that these differences relate to the magnitude of strain that the tendon experiences during normal activities in life. Tendon cells may be preprogrammed during embryological development for the strain they will encounter in life or may simply respond to the particular strain environment they are subjected to. The elucidation of controlling mechanisms resulting in tendon cell specialization will have important consequences for cell based therapies and engineering strategies to repair damaged tendons.},

	abstract = {Expression profiling of selected matrix remodeling genes was conducted to evaluate differences in molecular response to low-cycle (100) and high-cycle (7,200) sub-failure-fatigue loading of patellar tendons. Using our previously developed in vivo patellar tendon model, tendons were loaded for 100 or 7,200 cycles and expression of selected metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and collagens were quantified by real-time RT-PCR at 1- and 7-day post-loading. Expression profiles were also obtained from lacerated tendons as an acute injury model. The high-cycle group showed upregulation of TIMP-1, -2, Col3a1, and Col5a1, and downregulation TIMP-4 at both time points, upregulation of MMP-2 at 7-day post-loading and downregulation of MMP-13 and -14 at 1-day post-loading, suggesting overall repair/remodeling. In contrast, the low-cycle loaded group showed upregulation of MMP-2, -3, -13, and Col12a1 at both time points, upregulation of TIMP-1, -2, -3, Col3a1, and integrin β1 and downregulation of integrin α11 at 1-day post-loading and upregulation of Col1a1 at 7-day post-loading, consistent with a hypertrophic (adaptive) pattern. Lacerated tendons showed a typical acute wound response with upregulation of all examined remodeling genes. Differences found in tendon response to high- and low-cycle loading are suggestive of the underlying mechanisms associated with a healthy or damaging response. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term survival of patients with invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and the metastatic behavior of these two disease entities. Originally, all consecutive patients with pure lobular invasive breast cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 1999 in the area served by the Tampere University Hospital and their matched IDC controls were identified and re-evaluated histopathologically in this follow-up study, resulting in a total of 243 ILCs and 243 IDCs. Data on recurrences and survival were collected until the end of year 2009. Statistical analyses including Kaplan–Meier method, log-rank test, Fisher's exact test and Cox regression analysis were performed with the PASW Statistics 18.0 computer program. P-values of \&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Within the mean follow-up time of 10.04 years, locoregional recurrences were significantly more common among the ILCs than IDCs (35 vs. 20, p = 0.04), but no differences in the total number of distant recurrences or bilaterality were observed. However, when the first distant recurrence sites were studied, ILC patients had significantly less lung metastases (p = 0.04), but more skin metastases (p = 0.04). During the whole follow-up period IDCs metastasized significantly more frequently to the lungs (p = 0.002), whereas gastrointestinal metastases were more common among ILCs (p = 0.02). Although the known favorable prognostic factors (hormone receptor positivity, low grade, low s-phase) were more common for the ILCs, the disease-free survival, the overall survival and the survival after recurrence did not differ between the groups. However, the Cox-regression model showed significantly worse survival for ILCs after adjusting for age, TNM-status, grade and ER-positivity (p = 0.004).

In conclusion, ILC and IDC differ in respect for visceral metastases. Despite the known favorable prognostic factors and originally favorable survival, patients with lobular histology appear to have a worse survival in the multivariate analysis after a prolonged follow-up.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic decision-making for personalized management of breast cancer relies on patient stratification based on the risk conferred by clinicopathologic factors, such as stage, Ki67 Index (KI) and tumor histological grade. The most widely used histologic grading system for breast cancer, the Nottingham Grading System (NGS) provides prognostic information about breast tumor samples by combining analysis of the extent of glandular differentiation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity present in the tumor sample. In the NGS, the mitotic Index (MI) is defined as the number of mitotic cells per ten high-power fields. KI is a universal prognostic indicator but is not part of the NGS. Although the NGS has been widely used owing to its reproducibility and significant prognostic value, its accuracy in predicting disease prognosis and aggressiveness is limited. Our earlier work has demonstrated that by rationally integrating KI and MI into a new metric called the Ki67-Adjusted Mitotic Score (KAMS), which is a measure of the proportion of mitotic cells amongst Ki67-positive cells, we are able to glean a new layer of prognostic information about metastatic risk. We found that for Nottingham Grade II and III patients, high KAMS values predicted relatively better overall survival (OS) than low KAMS values. We therefore asked if the incorporation of a KAMS-based classifier subsequent to conventional Nottingham classification, would improve patient stratification to enable their funneling towards more optimal treatment choices. Ideal KAMS thresholds were established by analyzing the KAMS-stratified survival groups and selecting the thresholds which created the widest survival stratification that was additionally confirmed to be statistically significant via a Log-Rank test. For Nottingham Grade II and III patients, an above-threshold KAMS value was deemed as low-risk and a below-threshold KAMS value was deemed as high-risk for the purpose of grade adjustment. Grade adjustments were based solely on the patients’ KAMS values. Thus the adjusted Nottingham Grade I consisted of the original Nottingham Grade I patients along with KAMS determined low-risk original Nottingham Grade II patients. Adjusted Nottingham Grade II patients were composed of KAMS determined high-risk patients originally in Nottingham Grade II along with KAMS determined low-risk original Nottingham Grade III patients. Finally, the adjusted Nottingham Grade III was made up exclusively of high-risk patients from the original Nottingham Grade III. We found that the adjusted system represents a wider separation between OS curves with adjusted Grade I (n = 774) OS being 95.48\%, adjusted grade II (n = 727) OS at 87.62\%, and adjusted Grade III (n = 110) having an OS of 78.18\%. Overall survival groups between adjusted grade I and II and I and III (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) showed statistical significance. We also found that the hazard ratios for all Nottingham grades are significantly better after adjustment (2.875 versus 2.034 for Grade II and 5.115 versus 3.456 for Grade III) indicating that the KAMS can function as an effective risk-stratification biomarker and that incorporation of a KAMS-based classifier enhances patient stratification.

A methodology to study the relationship between clinical variables [e.g., prostate specific antigen (PSA) or Gleason score] and cancer spatial distribution is described. Three-dimensional (3-D) models of 216 glands are reconstructed from digital images of whole mount histopathological slices. The models are deformed into one prostate model selected as an atlas using a combination of rigid, affine, and B-spline deformable registration techniques. Spatial cancer distribution is assessed by counting the number of tumor occurrences among all glands in a given position of the 3-D registered atlas. Finally, a difference between proportions is used to compare different spatial distributions. As a proof of concept, we compare spatial distributions from patients with PSA greater and less than 5  ng/ml and from patients older and younger than 60 years. Results suggest that prostate cancer has a significant difference in the right zone of the prostate between populations with PSA greater and less than 5  ng/ml. Age does not have any impact in the spatial distribution of the disease. The proposed methodology can help to comprehend prostate cancer by understanding its spatial distribution and how it changes according to clinical parameters. Finally, this methodology can be easily adapted to other organs and pathologies.},

We investigated the use of controlled release of an antimetabolite, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), within glaucoma drains to determine if the wound healing response could be reduced and the useful life span of the device increased. Collagen plugs containing 1.125 mg of 5-FU were placed in the silicone tubes of modified Baerveldt glaucoma drains. Eight drains with 5-FU and eight drains without 5-FU were implanted in one eye each of 16 New Zealand white rabbits; the contralateral eyes served as unoperated controls. Results were evaluated in terms of IOP, fibrous capsule thickness, macrophage density, and presence of type III collagen surrounding the drain plate, 3 and 6 months after implantation. In general, eyes implanted with antimetabolite-containing drains demonstrated significantly lower values for all evaluated parameters at 3 months and lower or equal values at 6 months, compared with the eyes not receiving 5-FU and the unoperated controls, indicating improved IOP-lowering function, reduced bleb wall thickness, and earlier achievement of a steady-state wound healing response. All eyes remained healthy throughout the 6-month duration of the study with no cytotoxicity complications in any of the eyes. Thus, biodegradable plugs placed within the silicone tubes of glaucoma drains can safely deliver 5-FU to filtering blebs over time, which could prolong the functional life of the bleb by decreasing the thickness of the anterior fibrous capsule and permitting sufficient fluid outflow to reduce IOP to physiological levels.},

	abstract = {The mouse has proven to be an advantageous animal model system in basic science research focused on aiding in development and evaluation of potential treatments; however, the small size of mouse tendons makes consistent and reproducible injury models and subsequent biomechanical evaluation challenging for studying tendon healing. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and reproducibility of multiple mouse tendon injury models. Our hypothesis was that incisional (using a blade) and excisional (using a biopsy punch) injuries would result in consistent differences in tendon material properties. At 16 weeks of age, 17 C57BL/6 mice underwent surgery to create defects in the flexor digitorum longus, Achilles, or patellar tendon. Each animal received 1–2 full-thickness, central-width incisional or excisional injuries per limb; at least one tendon per limb remained uninjured. The injuries were distributed such that each tendon type had comparable numbers of uninjured, incisionally injured, and excisionally injured specimens. Three weeks after injury, all animals were euthanized and tendons were harvested for mechanical testing. As hypothesized, differences were detected for all three different tendon types at three weeks post-injury. While all models created injuries that produced predictable outcomes, the patellar tendon model was the most consistent in terms of number and size of significant differences in injured tendons compared to native properties, as well as in the overall variance in the data. This finding provides support for its use in fundamental tendon healing studies; however, future work may use any of these models, based on their appropriateness for the specific question under study.},

	volume = {40},
	issn = {0094-2405},
	doi = {10.1118/1.4790466},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Segmentation of breast lesions on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the first step in lesion diagnosis in a computer-aided diagnosis framework. Because manual segmentation of such lesions is both time consuming and highly susceptible to human error and issues of reproducibility, an automated lesion segmentation method is highly desirable. Traditional automated image segmentation methods such as boundary-based active contour (AC) models require a strong gradient at the lesion boundary. Even when region-based terms are introduced to an AC model, grayscale image intensities often do not allow for clear definition of foreground and background region statistics. Thus, there is a need to find alternative image representations that might provide (1) strong gradients at the margin of the object of interest (OOI); and (2) larger separation between intensity distributions and region statistics for the foreground and background, which are necessary to halt evolution of the AC model upon reaching the border of the OOI.
METHODS: In this paper, the authors introduce a spectral embedding (SE) based AC (SEAC) for lesion segmentation on breast DCE-MRI. SE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme, is applied to the DCE time series in a voxelwise fashion to reduce several time point images to a single parametric image where every voxel is characterized by the three dominant eigenvectors. This parametric eigenvector image (PrEIm) representation allows for better capture of image region statistics and stronger gradients for use with a hybrid AC model, which is driven by both boundary and region information. They compare SEAC to ACs that employ fuzzy c-means (FCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) as alternative image representations. Segmentation performance was evaluated by boundary and region metrics as well as comparing lesion classification using morphological features from SEAC, PCA+AC, and FCM+AC.
RESULTS: On a cohort of 50 breast DCE-MRI studies, PrEIm yielded overall better region and boundary-based statistics compared to the original DCE-MR image, FCM, and PCA based image representations. Additionally, SEAC outperformed a hybrid AC applied to both PCA and FCM image representations. Mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for SEAC was significantly better (DSC = 0.74 ± 0.21) than FCM+AC (DSC = 0.50 ± 0.32) and similar to PCA+AC (DSC = 0.73 ± 0.22). Boundary-based metrics of mean absolute difference and Hausdorff distance followed the same trends. Of the automated segmentation methods, breast lesion classification based on morphologic features derived from SEAC segmentation using a support vector machine classifier also performed better (AUC = 0.67 ± 0.05; p {\textless} 0.05) than FCM+AC (AUC = 0.50 ± 0.07), and PCA+AC (AUC = 0.49 ± 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we presented SEAC, an accurate, general purpose AC segmentation tool that could be applied to any imaging domain that employs time series data. SE allows for projection of time series data into a PrEIm representation so that every voxel is characterized by the dominant eigenvectors, capturing the global and local time-intensity curve similarities in the data. This PrEIm allows for the calculation of strong tensor gradients and better region statistics than the original image intensities or alternative image representations such as PCA and FCM. The PrEIm also allows for building a more accurate hybrid AC scheme.},

	abstract = {Over 4 million U.S. men and women suffer from Alzheimer's disease; 1 million from Parkinson's disease; 350,000 from multiple sclerosis (MS); and 20,000 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Worldwide, these four diseases account for more than 20 million patients. In addition, aging greatly increases the risk of neurodegenerative disease. Although great progress has been made in recent years toward understanding of these diseases, few effective treatments and no cures are currently available. This is mainly due to the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that allows only 5\% of the 7000 small-molecule drugs available to treat only a tiny fraction of these diseases. On the other hand, safe and localized opening of the BBB has been proven to present a significant challenge. Of the methods used for BBB disruption shown to be effective, Focused Ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with microbubbles, is the only technique that can induce localized BBB opening noninvasively and regionally. FUS may thus have a huge impact in trans-BBB brain drug delivery. The primary objective in this paper is to elucidate the interactions between ultrasound, microbubbles and the local microenvironment during BBB opening with FUS, which are responsible for inducing the BBB disruption. The mechanism of the BBB opening in vivo is monitored through the MRI and passive cavitation detection (PCD), and the safety of BBB disruption is assessed using H\&E histology at distinct pressures, pulse lengths and microbubble diameters. It is hereby shown that the BBB can be disrupted safely and transiently under specific acoustic pressures (under 0.45 MPa) and microbubble (diameter under 8 μm) conditions.},

Recent evidence suggests that type II diabetes may cause alterations in collagen structure, such as irregular fibril morphology and density, which could play a role in the mechanical function of tendons. Using the db/db mouse model of type II diabetes, the diabetic skin was found to have impaired biomechanical properties when compared to the non-diabetic group. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of diabetes on biomechanics, collagen fiber re-alignment, and biochemistry in three functionally different tendons (Achilles, supraspinatus, patellar) using the db/db mouse model. Results showed that cross-sectional area and stiffness, but not modulus, were significantly reduced in all three tendons. However, the tendon response to load (transition strain, collagen fiber re-alignment) occurred earlier in the mechanical test, contrary to expectations. In addition, the patellar tendon had an altered response to diabetes when compared to the other two tendons, with no changes in fiber re-alignment and decreased collagen content at the midsubstance of the tendon. Overall, type II diabetes alters tendon mechanical properties and the dynamic response to load.},

	abstract = {Learning how to separate benign confounders from prostate cancer is important because the imaging characteristics of these confounders are poorly understood. Furthermore, the typical representations of the MRI parameters might not be enough to allow discrimination. The diagnostic uncertainty this causes leads to a lower diagnostic accuracy. In this paper a new cascaded classifier is introduced to separate prostate cancer and benign confounders on MRI in conjunction with specific computer-extracted features to distinguish each of the benign classes (benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), inflammation, atrophy or prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN). In this study we tried to (1) calculate different mathematical representations of the MRI parameters which more clearly express subtle differences between different classes, (2) learn which of the MRI image features will allow to distinguish specific benign confounders from prostate cancer, and (2) find the combination of computer-extracted MRI features to best discriminate cancer from the confounding classes using a cascaded classifier. One of the most important requirements for identifying MRI signatures for adenocarcinoma, BPH, atrophy, inflammation, and PIN is accurate mapping of the location and spatial extent of the confounder and cancer categories from ex vivo histopathology to MRI. Towards this end we employed an annotated prostatectomy data set of 31 patients, all of whom underwent a multi-parametric 3 Tesla MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. The prostatectomy slides were carefully co-registered to the corresponding MRI slices using an elastic registration technique. We extracted texture features from the T2-weighted imaging, pharmacokinetic features from the dynamic contrast enhanced imaging and diffusion features from the diffusion-weighted imaging for each of the confounder classes and prostate cancer. These features were selected because they form the mainstay of clinical diagnosis. Relevant features for each of the classes were selected using maximum relevance minimum redundancy feature selection, allowing us to perform classifier independent feature selection. The selected features were then incorporated in a cascading classifier, which can focus on easier sub-tasks at each stage, leaving the more difficult classification tasks for later stages. Results show that distinct features are relevant for each of the benign classes, for example the fraction of extra-vascular, extra-cellular space in a voxel is a clear discriminator for inflammation. Furthermore, the cascaded classifier outperforms both multi-class and one-shot classifiers in overall accuracy for discriminating confounders from cancer: 0.76 versus 0.71 and 0.62.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) results in tumour-positive surgical margins in up to 40\% of the patients. Therefore, new imaging techniques are needed that support the surgeon with real-time feedback on tumour location and margin status. In this study, the potential of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in BCS for pre- and intraoperative tumour localization, margin status assessment and detection of residual disease was assessed in tissue-simulating breast phantoms.
Methods
Breast-shaped phantoms were produced with optical properties that closely match those of normal breast tissue. Fluorescent tumour-like inclusions containing indocyanine green (ICG) were positioned at predefined locations in the phantoms to allow for simulation of (i) preoperative tumour localization, (ii) real-time NIRF-guided tumour resection, and (iii) intraoperative margin assessment. Optical imaging was performed using a custom-made clinical prototype NIRF intraoperative camera.
Results
Tumour-like inclusions in breast phantoms could be detected up to a depth of 21 mm using a NIRF intraoperative camera system. Real-time NIRF-guided resection of tumour-like inclusions proved feasible. Moreover, intraoperative NIRF imaging reliably detected residual disease in case of inadequate resection.
Conclusion
We evaluated the potential of NIRF imaging applications for BCS. The clinical setting was simulated by exploiting tissue-like breast phantoms with fluorescent tumour-like agarose inclusions. From this evaluation, we conclude that intraoperative NIRF imaging is feasible and may improve BCS by providing the surgeon with imaging information on tumour location, margin status, and presence of residual disease in real-time. Clinical studies are needed to further validate these results.},

One of the major bottlenecks in the critical path is the image mosaicing process where 2D slices are assembled from scanned microscopy image tiles. The problem of assembling the tiles is computationally non-trivial because of distortion of the specimen in the electron microscope due to heat and overlap between the scanned tiles. The complexity of the calculation arises from the massive size of the dataset and mathematical calculations required to calculate value of each pixel of the mosaic. We propose to use texture memory lookups to speedup the access to image tiles and data parallel computing enabled by the GPUs to accelerate this process. The proposed method results in noticeable improvements in speed of computation compared to other methods. Index Terms—Serial-section TEM, image mosaicing, GPGPU, CUDA, texture},

	abstract = {Automated nuclear detection is a critical step for a number of computer assisted pathology related image analysis algorithms such as for automated grading of breast cancer tissue specimens. The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images. However, automated nucleus detection is complicated by (1) the large number of nuclei and the size of high resolution digitized pathology images, and (2) the variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the individual nuclei. Recently there has been interest in the application of "Deep Learning" strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the autoencoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or nonnuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200×2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84:49\% and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78:83\%. The SSAE approach also out-performed 9 other state of the art nuclear detection strategies.},

Accurate ex vivo assessments would greatly broaden the applicability of optical measurements of metabolism. We investigate the use of live tissue culture experiments to serve as a surrogate for in vivo metabolic measurements. To validate this approach, NADH and FAD fluorescence intensity and lifetime images were acquired with a two-photon microscope from hamster cheek pouch epithelia in vivo, from biopsies maintained in live tissue culture up to 48 h, and from flash-frozen and thawed biopsies. We found that the optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NADH/FAD) of the cultured biopsy was statistically identical to the in vivo measurement until 24 h, while the redox ratio of the frozen-thawed samples decreased by 15\% (p{\textless}0.01). The NADH mean fluorescence lifetime (τm) remained unchanged (p{\textgreater}0.05) during the first 8 h of tissue culture, while the NADH τm of frozen-thawed samples increased by 13\% (p{\textless}0.001). Cellular morphology did not significantly change between in vivo, cultured, and frozen-thawed tissues (p{\textgreater}0.05). All results were consistent across multiple depth layers in this stratified squamous epithelial tissue. Histological markers for proliferation and apoptosis also confirm the viability of tissues maintained in culture. This study suggests that short-term ex vivo tissue culture may be more appropriate than frozen-thawed tissue for optical metabolic and morphologic measurements that approximate in vivo status.},

	abstract = {Optical fluorescence-guided imaging is increasingly used to guide surgery and endoscopic procedures. Activatable probes are particularly useful because of high target-to-background ratios that increase sensitivity for tiny cancer foci. However, green fluorescent activatable probes suffer from interference from autofluorescence found in biological tissue. The purpose of this study was to determine if dynamic imaging can be used to differentiate specific fluorescence arising from an activated probe in a tumor from autofluorescence in background tissues especially when low concentrations of the dye are applied. Serial fluorescence imaging was performed using various concentrations of γ-glutamyl hydroxymethyl rhodamine green (gGlu-HMRG) which was sprayed on the peritoneal surface with tiny implants of SHIN3-DsRed ovarian cancer tumors. Temporal differences in signal between specific green fluorescence in cancer foci and non-specific autofluorescence in background tissue were measured at 5, 10, 20 and 30 min after application of gGlu-HMRG and were processed into three kinetic maps reflecting maximum fluorescence signal (MF), wash-in rate (WIR), and area under the curve (AUC), respectively. Using concentrations up to 10 μM of gGlu-HMRG, the fluorescence intensity of cancer foci was significantly higher than that of small intestine but only at 30 min. However, on kinetic maps derived from dynamic fluorescence imaging, the signal of cancer foci was significantly higher than that of small intestine after only 5 min even at concentrations as low as 2.5 μM of gGlu-HMRG (p {\textless} 0.01). At lower concentrations, kinetic maps derived from dynamic fluorescence imaging were superior to unprocessed images for cancer detection.},

	abstract = {In the era of population-based organized mammographic screening, breast carcinoma is detected at an early stage of its natural history and corresponds to pure in situ carcinomas and/or invasive carcinomas {\textless} 15 mm in size in more than half of the cases. These tumours are characterized in general by less aggressive biological phenotypic parameters as compared with their more advanced counterparts, and they have an excellent long-term prognosis. Nevertheless, breast cancer in these early stages is already heterogeneous, and neither the first-generation prognostic factors (the tumour size, the extent of the in situ component, the lymph node status and the histology grade), nor the usual additional parameters (the receptor status and proliferation markers) are reliable enough to allow an estimate of the outcome. Newer approaches to a classification of early breast cancer include a consideration of the mammographic appearance, the extent of the disease instead of just the largest dimension of the main invasive focus, and the mode of detection or the use of molecular tests. Early breast cancers may occupy a relatively large area as they are multifocal and extensive in a considerable number of cases. Detailed preoperative characterization of the tumours with modern imaging methods and careful selection of the cases for individualized treatment ensure fewer complications and a long disease-free survival. Guidelines developed for the adjuvant therapy of operable breast cancers should not be implemented automatically for cancers in the very early stages. Most cancers in the very early stages do not need adjuvant systemic therapy; aggressive therapy should be reserved for high-risk cases. A further reduction of therapy-related risks may be achieved by the implementation of individualized radiotherapy or its avoidance in selected cases.},

Type-I (Col1) and type-II (Col2) collagens play important roles in tendon midsubstance and tendon-to-bone insertion healing, respectively. Using double transgenic mice, this study aims to spatiotemporally monitor Col1 and Col2 gene expression, histology, and biomechanics up to 8 weeks following a full-length patellar tendon injury. Gene expression and histology were analyzed weekly for up to 5 weeks while mechanical properties were measured at 1, 2, 5, and 8 weeks. At week 1, the healing region displayed loose granulation tissue with little Col1 expression. Col1 expression peaked at 2 weeks, but the ECM was highly disorganized and hypercellular. By 3 weeks, Col1 expression had reduced and by 5 weeks, the ECM was generally aligned along the tendon axis. Col2 expression was not seen in the healing midsubstance or insertion at any time point. The biomechanics of the healing tissue was inadequate at all time points, achieving ultimate loads and stiffnesses of 48\% and 63\% of normal values by 8 weeks. Future studies will further characterize the cells within the healing midsubstance and insertion using tenogenic markers and compare these results to those of tendon cells during normal development. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Orphan nuclear receptors are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily and are so named because their endogenous physiological ligands are either unknown or may not exist. Because of their important regulatory roles in many key physiological processes, dysregulation of signalings controlled by these receptors is associated with many diseases including cancer. Over years, studies of orphan NRs have become an area of great interest because their specific physiological and pathological roles have not been well-defined, and some of them are promising drug targets for diseases. The recently identified synthetic small molecule ligands, acting as agonists or antagonists, to these orphan NRs not only help to understand better their functional roles but also highlight that the signalings mediated by these ligand-independent NRs in diseases could be therapeutically intervened. This review is a summary of the recent advances in elucidating the emerging functional roles of orphan NRs in cancers, especially prostate cancer. In particular, some orphan NRs, RORγ, TR2, TR4, COUP-IFII, ERRα, DAX1 and SHP, exhibit crosstalk or interference with androgen receptor (AR) signaling in either normal or malignant prostatic cells, highlighting their involvement in prostate cancer progression as androgen and AR signaling pathway play critical roles in this process. We also propose that a better understanding of the mechanism of actions of these orphan NRs in prostate gland or prostate cancer could help to evaluate their potential value as therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Researchers in various fields are using optical microscopy to acquire very large images, 10000 - 200000 of pixels per side. Optical microscopes acquire these images as grids of overlapping partial images (thousands of pixels per side) that are then stitched together via software. Composing such large images is a compute and data intensive task even for modern machines. Researchers compound this difficulty further by obtaining time-series, volumetric, or multiple channel images with the resulting data sets now having or approaching terabyte sizes. We present a scalable hybrid CPU-GPU implementation of image stitching that processes large image sets at near interactive rates. Our implementation scales well with both image sizes and the number of CPU cores and GPU cards in a machine. It processes a grid of 42 × 59 tiles into a 17 k × 22 k pixels image in 43 s (end-to-end execution times) when using one NVIDIA Tesla C2070 card and two Intel Xeon E-5620 quad-core CPUs, and in 29 s when using two Tesla C2070 cards and the same two CPUs. It also composes and renders the composite image without saving it in 15 s. In comparison, ImageJ/Fiji, which is widely used by biologists, has an image stitching plugin that takes {\textgreater} 3.6 h for the same workload despite being multithreaded and executing the same mathematical operators, it composes and saves the large image in an additional 1.5 h. This implementation takes advantage of coarse-grain parallelism. It organizes the computation into a pipeline architecture that spans CPU and GPU resources and overlaps computation with data motion. The implementation achieves a nearly 10× performance improvement over our optimized non-pipeline GPU implementation and demonstrates near-linear speedup when increasing CPU thread count and increasing number of GPUs.},

A meaningful impact on cancer screening, staging, and treatment is unlikely to occur until the tumor-to-background ratio improves by three to four orders of magnitude (ie, 103- to 104-fold), which in turn will require proportional improvements in sensitivity and contrast agent targeting. This review analyzes the physics and chemistry of cancer imaging and highlights the fundamental principles underlying the detection of malignant cells within a background of normal cells. The use of various contrast agents and radiotracers for cancer imaging is reviewed, as are the current limitations of ultrasound, x-ray imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography (PET), and optical imaging. Innovative technologies are emerging that hold great promise for patients, such as positron emission mammography of the breast and spectroscopy-enhanced colonoscopy for cancer screening, hyperpolarization MRI and time-of-flight PET for staging, and ion beam-induced PET scanning and near-infrared fluorescence-guided surgery for cancer treatment. This review explores these emerging technologies and considers their potential impact on clinical care. Finally, those cancers that are currently difficult to image and quantify, such as ovarian cancer and acute leukemia, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Questions of reproducibility and efficacy of histologic malignancy grading relative to alternative proliferation index measurements for outcome prediction remain unanswered. Microsections of specimens from the Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue Resource (CBCTR) were evaluated by seven pathologists for reproducibility of grade and classification. Nuclear figure classification was assessed using photographs. Grade was assigned by the Bloom–Richardson method, Nottingham modification. Proliferation index was evaluated prospectively by deoxyribose nucleic acid precursor uptake with thymidine (autoradiographic) or bromodeoxyuridine (immunohistochemical) labeling index using fresh tissue from 631 node-negative breast cancer patients accessioned at St Luke's Hospital. A modified Nottingham–Bloom–Richardson grade was derived from histopathologic data. Median post-treatment observation was 6.4 years. Agreement on classification of nuclear figures (N=43) was less than good by kappa statistic (=0.38). Grade was moderately reproducible in four trials (N=10,10,19, 10) with CBCTR specimens (=0.50–0.59). Of components of Bloom–Richardson grade, agreement was least for nuclear pleomorphism (=0.37–0.50), best for tubularity (=0.57–0.83), and intermediate for mitotic count (=0.45–0.64). Bloom–Richardson grade was a univariate predictor of prognosis in node-negative St Luke's patients, and was improved when mitotic count was replaced by labeling index (low, mid, or high). When labeling index was added to a multivariate model containing tumor size and vessel invasion, grade was no longer a significant predictor of tumor-specific relapse-free or overall survival. Mitotic index predicted best when intervals were lowered to 0–2, 3–10, and {\textgreater}10 mitotic figures per ten 0.18 mm2 high-power fields. We conclude that Nottingham–Bloom–Richardson grades remain only modestly reproducible. Prognostically useful components of grade are mitotic index and tubularity. The Nottingham–Bloom–Richardson system can be improved by lowering cutoffs for mitotic index and by counting 20–30 rather than 10 high-power fields. Measurement of proliferation index by immunohistochemically detectable markers will probably give superior prognostic results in comparison to grade.},

In their retrospective study, at some time after the initial lumpectomy a reexcision was performed in 48.9\% of patients who did not have frozen section margin evaluation compared with only 14.9\% of those in whom frozen section evaluation of the margins was performed. Further, these investigators developed a technique to overcome the methodological difficulties of attempting to cut frozen sections of fatty tissue such as margins of breast specimens. So if it is now technically feasible to obtain adequate frozen sections from lumpectomy margins and if intraoperative frozen section evaluations of these margins can reduce the need for a subsequent reexcision by almost 70\%, should pathologists the world over be gearing up to routinely freeze margins of breast lumpectomy specimens? To answer this question, we must first review some fundamental data on lumpectomy margins and their association with local recurrence, and put these data into current clinical context.

Various patient factors, treatment factors, and pathologic factors have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence in the ipsilateral breast (local recurrence) after breast-conserving treatment for invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Arguably the most important of these is the status of the microscopic margins of excision of the resected breast specimen. Positive margins (ie, invasive carcinoma or DCIS at an inked tissue edge) have consistently been associated with a higher risk of local recurrence than negative margins.2 Therefore, obtaining negative margins is the primary goal of breast-conserving surgery. Unfortunately, there is far from universal agreement as to what constitutes an adequate negative margin. In fact, results of surveys of surgeons and …},

Emphasizing circumstances that determine increasingly popular surgical approach of breast conserving surgery (BCS), used in lower grade breast tumors, while maintaining survival that is found when more radical procedures are used.

Patients and methods
Several leading oncological protocols in the world are compared, using PubMed database, and our own experience. Data gathered are compared to conclusions of Consensus Conference on Breast Conservation (Milan, 2005). Furthermore, surgical contraindications found in our everyday work are considered, having in mind satisfactory cosmetic outcome, as well as keeping the 1 cm border of “clear” edges. Such more practical problems of edge detection can compromise BCS results.

Results
After observing several relevant protocols, we found very high frequency of mastectomy vs. BCS, despite the fact that stage of disease was low. We also found only 20\% of absolute contraindications for BCS. Most frequent contraindication for BCS was multicentricity of the tumor (with micro calcifications), especially in ductal in situ carcinoma.

Conclusion
BCS followed by radiation therapy with tumor-free edges is standard procedure in treatment of T1 and small T2 breast cancers. This approach implies higher risk of local recurrence (LR), although local recurrence is low (1\% per year), with rates of survival similar to radical procedures.},

This study evaluates frozen section accuracy relative to permanent controls and final margins from the entire specimen, the rate at which frozen sections impact intraoperative management, and the resultant cost. Study Design Retrospective. Methods From 1997 to 1999 the frozen section results, permanent controls, and final tumor margins from 80 consecutive patients undergoing 420 intraoperative frozen section margins for head and neck malignancy were reviewed. Results A 98.3\% accuracy rate (sensitivity, 88.8\%; specificity, 98.9\%) was found compared with permanent sections of the same tissue. However, 40\% (8 of 20) of patients with positive final margins on the resection specimen, and 100\% (15 of 15) with close ({\textless}5 mm) margins were not detected by frozen section analysis. The overall accuracy of frozen section in the evaluation of close or positive final margins was 71.3\% (sensitivity, 34.3\%; specificity, 100\%). In addition, 5\% (4 of 80) of patients potentially benefited from intraoperative frozen section by virtue of immediate margin revision. The estimated cost of intraoperative frozen section averaged as much as \$3123 per patient, with a cost-benefit ratio of 20:1. Conclusions Intraoperative frozen section margins are accurate, but they are costly and cannot reliably eradicate positive final margins. Patients with early-stage lesions and those undergoing re-resection for recurrence or salvage surgery after radiation failure derived the greatest potential benefit from frozen section margins.},

	abstract = {Automated detection and segmentation of nuclear and glandular structures is critical for classification and grading of prostate and breast cancer histopathology. In this paper, we present a methodology for automated detection and segmentation of structures of interest in digitized histopathology images. The scheme integrates image information from across three different scales: (1) low- level information based on pixel values, (2) high-level information based on relationships between pixels for object detection, and (3) domain-specific information based on relationships between histological structures. Low-level information is utilized by a Bayesian classifier to generate a likelihood that each pixel belongs to an object of interest. High-level information is extracted in two ways: (i) by a level-set algorithm, where a contour is evolved in the likelihood scenes generated by the Bayesian classifier to identify object boundaries, and (ii) by a template matching algorithm, where shape models are used to identify glands and nuclei from the low-level likelihood scenes. Structural constraints are imposed via domain- specific knowledge in order to verify whether the detected objects do indeed belong to structures of interest. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of our glandular and nuclear segmentation algorithm in accurate extraction of various morphological and nuclear features for automated grading of (a) prostate cancer, (b) breast cancer, and (c) distinguishing between cancerous and benign breast histology specimens. The efficacy of our segmentation algorithm is evaluated by comparing breast and prostate cancer grading and benign vs. cancer discrimination accuracies with corresponding accuracies obtained via manual detection and segmentation of glands and nuclei.},

	abstract = {Background
Genomics and proteomics are nowadays the dominant techniques for novel biomarker discovery. However, histopathology images contain a wealth of information related to the tumor histology, morphology and tumor-host interactions that is not accessible through these techniques. Thus, integrating the histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow could potentially lead to the identification of new image-based biomarkers and the refinement or even replacement of the existing genomic and proteomic signatures. However, extracting meaningful and robust image features to be mined jointly with genomic (and clinical, etc.) data represents a real challenge due to the complexity of the images.

Results
We developed a framework for integrating the histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow based on the bag-of-features approach – a method that has the advantage of being assumption-free and data-driven. The images were reduced to a set of salient patterns and additional measurements of their spatial distribution, with the resulting features being directly used in a standard biomarker discovery application. We demonstrated this framework in a search for prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer which resulted in the identification of several prognostic image features and a promising multimodal (imaging and genomic) prognostic signature. The source code for the image analysis procedures is freely available.

Conclusions
The framework proposed allows for a joint analysis of images and gene expression data. Its application to a set of breast cancer cases resulted in image-based and combined (image and genomic) prognostic scores for relapse-free survival.

The Ahmed Baerveldt Comparison (ABC) Study compares the long-term outcomes and complications of the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV; model FP7; New World Medical, Los Ranchos, CA) and the Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI; model 101-350; Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL).
Design
Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
Participants
Two hundred seventy-six glaucoma patients at 16 clinical centers worldwide who were 18 to 85 years of age with inadequately controlled intraocular pressure (IOP; ≥18 mmHg) in whom placement of an aqueous shunt was planned.
Methods
Study patients were randomized to undergo implantation of an AGV or a BGI.
Main Outcome Measures
Failure, defined as IOP \&gt;21 mmHg or not reduced by 20\% less than baseline or IOP ≤5 mmHg (2 consecutive visits after 3 months), additional glaucoma surgery, removal of the implant, or loss of light perception vision.
Results
A total of 276 patients were enrolled between October 2006 and April 2008, including 143 in the AGV group and 133 in the BGI group. The mean age±standard deviation (SD) of patients enrolled was 63±14 years, and 52\% were male. The mean baseline IOP±SD was 31.5±11.8 mmHg. Except for a 13\% higher prevalence of hypertension in the AGV group, no significant differences in baseline demographic or ocular characteristics were observed between the study groups. Intraoperative complications occurred in 11 (8\%) patients in the AGV group and in 16 (12\%) patients in the BGI group (P = 0.31).
Conclusions
The ABC Study should yield valuable prospective data comparing 2 commonly used aqueous shunts in clinical practice.

A multiple level feature set, including pixel-, object-, and semantic-level features derived from convolutional neural networks (CNN), is extracted from 106 hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy tissue studies from 106 women patients. These multi-level features allow not only characterization of cancer morphology, but also extraction of structural and interpretable information within the histopathological images. In this study, an improved hybrid active contour model based segmentation method was used to segment nuclei from the images. The semantic-level features were extracted by a CNN approach, which described the proportions of nuclei belonging to the different grades, in conjunction with pixel-level (texture) and object-level (architecture) features, to create an integrated set of image attributes that can potentially outperform either subtype of features individually. We utilized a cascaded approach to train multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using combinations of feature subtypes to enable the possibility of maximizing the performance by leveraging different feature sets extracted from multiple levels. Final class (cancer grade) was determined by combining the scores produced by the individual SVM classifiers. By employing a light (three-layer) CNN model and parallel computing, the presented approach is computationally efficient and applicable to large-scale datasets. The method achieved an accuracy of 0.92 for low versus high, 0.77 for low versus intermediate, and 0.76 for intermediate versus high, and an overall accuracy of 0.69 when discriminating low, intermediate, and high grades of histopathological breast cancer images. This suggested that our grading method could be useful in developing a computational diagnostic tool for differentiating breast cancer grades, which might enable objective and reproducible alternative for diagnosis.},

	abstract = {An Automated Pathologist Reads Cancer Biopsies
How is a camera different from the human eye? Only the eye’s images undergo extensive secondary processing as they are interpreted by the human brain. But what if we could program a computer to do the secondary processing? A pathologist reading a cancer biopsy slide matches his or her brain’s memory of certain cancer-related features (tubules, atypical nuclei, and mitosis) against the tissue. This decades-old scoring system is still standard in most places for prognosis and treatment of cancer, despite its variability and often unreliability. Now, Beck et al. have created an automated pathologist by replacing the human brain with sophisticated image processing software and instructing it to find quantitative aspects of breast cancer tissue that predict prognosis. The software located a set of features that strongly predicted breast cancer outcome in both training and validation samples.
With an image analysis protocol they termed C-Path, the authors set their program loose on a set of samples from patients in the Netherlands. From more than 6000 features, the software found a set that were associated with samples from patients who had died sooner. The key aspect of this analysis was that these features were not predefined by a pathologist as being relevant to cancer; instead, the software itself found the cancer-related features among the very large set of measurements of the image. Classifying the tissue as epithelial or stromal, an important part of cancer diagnosis, took a bit of extra work: The authors needed to provide the software with some hand-marked samples so it could learn the difference. The C-Path score yielded information above and beyond that from many other measures of cancer severity including pathology grade, estrogen receptor status, tumor size, and lymph node status. In another, completely independent group of women from Vancouver, the C-Path score was also associated with overall survival.
An unexpected finding was that the features that were the best predictors of patient survival were not from the cancer itself but were from the adjacent stromal tissue. Women with worse outcomes tended to have thin cords of epithelial cells infiltrating the stroma, which resulted in high-risk stromal matrix variability scores. These patients also tended to have more inflammatory cells in the stroma (picked up as dark areas by the software). Replacing the human brain with an unbiased image processing system can extract more information from microcopy images and discover new biological aspects of cancer tissue.
Automated quantification of thousands of morphologic features in microscopic images of breast cancer allows the construction of a robust prognostic model.

This research area has become particularly relevant with the advent of whole slide imaging (WSI) scanners, which can perform cost-effective and high-throughput histopathology slide digitization, and which aim at replacing the optical microscope as the primary tool used by pathologist. Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancers among women, and image analysis methods that target this disease have a huge potential to reduce the workload in a typical pathology lab and to improve the quality of the interpretation. This paper is meant as an introduction for nonexperts. It starts with an overview of the tissue preparation, staining and slide digitization processes followed by a discussion of the different image processing techniques and applications, ranging from analysis of tissue staining to computer-aided diagnosis, and prognosis of breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction/Background
The increase of prostate cancer diagnosis after the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening resulted in overtreatment of patients with low risk tumors. The histological Gleason score (GS) revised in 2005 by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) is currently the most reliable tool to separate aggressive from indolent prostate cancer.
Materials and Methods
Using the new 2005 GS criteria we retrospectively evaluated biopsy and surgical samples of 1344 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in our institution. According to the new GS criteria we then selected 134 patients who would have been suitable for active surveillance at the time of biopsy (at least 2 positive cores, PSA \&lt; 10 ng/mL, GS ≤ 6). We finally assessed the accuracy of the revised GS in biopsy to predict indolent cancer in the prostatectomy specimens.
Results
The mean GS increased from 6 to 7 after histological revision in biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. Histological revision determined a significant decrease of patients with GS ≤ 6 and an increase of those with GS ≥ 7 (all P \&lt; .001). The average of pathologically indolent disease (organ-confined, GS ≤ 6 at surgery, tumor of any volume) significantly decreased after histological revision (P \&lt; .001).
Conclusion
The revised ISUP 2005 criteria for Gleason grading provided better stratification of GS ≤ 6 prostate cancer and improved the accuracy for the histological diagnosis of indolent prostate cancer in biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.},

	volume = {27},
	issn = {0021-9290},
	abstract = {Growth and remodeling in tissues may be modulated by mechanical factors such as stress. For example, in cardiac hypertrophy, alterations in wall stress arising from changes in mechanical loading lead to cardiac growth and remodeling. A general continuum formulation for finite volumetric growth in soft elastic tissues is therefore proposed. The shape change of an unloaded tissue during growth is described by a mapping analogous to the deformation gradient tensor. This mapping is decomposed into a transformation of the local zero-stress reference state and an accompanying elastic deformation that ensures the compatibility of the total growth deformation. Residual stress arises from this elastic deformation. Hence, a complete kinematic formulation for growth in general requires a knowledge of the constitutive law for stress in the tissue. Since growth may in turn be affected by stress in the tissue, a general form for the stress-dependent growth law is proposed as a relation between the symmetric growth-rate tensor and the stress tensor. With a thick-walled hollow cylinder of incompressible, isotropic hyperelastic material as an example, the mechanics of left ventricular hypertrophy are investigated. The results show that transmurally uniform pure circumferential growth, which may be similar to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, changes the state of residual stress in the heart wall. A model of axially loaded bone is used to test a simple stress-dependent growth law in which growth rate depends on the difference between the stress due to loading and a predetermined growth equilibrium stress.},
